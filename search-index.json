A few examples of published contracts will suffice to illustrate this. Michelangelo Buonarroti was commissioned with cameral obligation to design the tomb of Julius II.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a> The same formula was used for Caravaggio’s contracts for work in San Luigi dei Francesi<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> and in Santa Maria del Popolo;<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a> for Nicolas Cordier’s contract for the bronze statue of Henri IV of France in San Giovanni in Laterano;<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a> and for Peter Paul Rubens’s contract for the high altarpiece of the Chiesa Nuova.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a> When it was feared that the dome of the Sapienza was too heavy, Francesco Borromini stood surety pledging the cameral obligation.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a></p>\n<p>Furthermore, the documents that have been transcribed and digitized for the National Gallery’s research project, <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma</em>, testify to the frequent use of the cameral obligation in the juridical relationships on which the activity of Roman artists was based.</p>\n<p>The Accademia’s statute stipulated that any “imprestanza” (loan, or commodate, which is a gratuitous loan) to the associates had to be formalized with the cameral obligation.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a> Many types of obligations were assumed in cameral form: rents, sureties, census, etc. Artists also undertook to pay the tax on evaluations <em>in forma Camerae</em>, paying the Accademia 2 percent of the work’s estimated value. In fact, what the statutes called the <em>Forma della Polliza da farsi &amp; sottoscriversi da quelli che vorranno le stime</em><a href=\"/endnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a> is expressed in the notarial documents as cameral obligation. Among the many examples we have,<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a> there is that of Guido Reni, who in 1609 promised to render 2 percent of what he was to be paid for his work at the Palazzo Apostolico, which still had to be appraised.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1607 the curate of the church of San Luca, Andrea Glacisco, after having received the inventory of the movable property in the sacristy, undertook with cameral obligation to give an account of said property whenever requested by the Accademia.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1621 the members of the secret congregation pledged <em>in forma Camerae</em> to comply with the brief of Gregory XV, who had confirmed the statutes of the Accademia.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a> Furthermore, the deputies of the Congregazione dei Pittori undertook with the cameral formula to celebrate intercessory masses in the church of San Luca.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>  There are many more examples that could be cited.</p>\n<p>The essay continues with discussion of the following topics: (1) what was the origin and history of the cameral obligation; (2) who had jurisdiction over the cameral obligation; (3) what was the <em>executio parata</em> (forced execution of debt characterized by particular celerity) that the cameral obligation guaranteed and how was it linked to excommunication; (4) what was the role of notaries in the procedure; (5) how was it implemented. To this end we will try to point out the differences between the <em>stylus antiquus</em> of the obligation <em>in forma Camerae</em> (before 1570) and the <em>stylus modernus</em>, adopted exclusively in the documents of the Accademia. Finally, in the conclusion, we will indicate how to recognize the cameral formula in the notarial documents. An appendix will provide a list (not exhaustive) of Accademia documents—contained in the National Gallery of Art’s database—in which the cameral formula is given in abbreviated form.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Header image: Archivio di Stato di Roma, TCS, Vol. 0551, 1637, fol. 387v (detail)</em></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":752,"title":"The Cameral Obligation in the Documents of the Accademia di San Luca","type":"splash","url":"http://localhost:8080/cameral_obligation/"},{"content":"<p>The cameral obligation (<em>obligatio cameralis</em> or <em>in forma Camerae</em>) takes its name from the Camera Apostolica, the ministry in charge of the finances and economy of the Holy See. It was created initially to guarantee the cameral credits, which consisted mainly of annates, that is taxes on ecclesiastical benefices from around the world. The payment of these credits, fiscal in nature, was complicated for two reasons. Firstly, for the actual difficulty of obtaining a forced execution in distant regions governed by different laws. Secondly, because many debtors were not prompt in paying, preferring to wait to be condemned by three consistent judgments: after which, according to common law, appeals could no longer be presented and the decision became legally binding.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a></p>\n<p>The remedy adopted, to which Guglielmo Durante already alluded in his <em>Speculum Iudiciale</em> (c. 1290), was highly effective in solving both problems: the debtor was required to swear to fulfill within a certain period, or otherwise renounce any exception or appeal; the debtor was then warned that in case of failure to fulfill, he would automatically be excommunicated.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> Through his bishop, therefore, the debtor could be sentenced to excommunication wherever he happened to be.</p>\n<p>During the Council of Constance at the beginning of the 15th century, this procedure was heavily criticized for its oppressive nature, given the irrefutable disparity of power between the person imposing it and the one enduring it. It was defined as violent, against the law, even simoniacal.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a> After the Council, the payment of taxes on benefices was regulated by the church on the basis of concordats with the individual states. This led to more limited use of the cameral obligations. From the 16th century on, they appeared mainly in contracts between private individuals.</p>\n<p>The life of the cameral obligation was long. It lasted until the beginning of the 19th century, when Pius VII’s Code of Civil Procedure of 1817 abolished the effects of the clause for the future. This provision, although confirmed by Leo XII (1824) and Gregory XVI (1831), was not included in the <em>Regolamento di procedura nei giudizi civili</em> of 1834, which specifically abolished the earlier codes: for this reason, still for some time after its promulgation, cases deriving from contracts stipulated with the cameral formula continued to be processed, until 1843 when it was declared definitively terminated.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":385,"title":"Origin of the Cameral Obligation","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/cameral_obligation/I_origin/"},{"content":"<p>The executive procedure initiated by contracts containing the cameral formula was reserved—at least in theory—to the jurisdiction of a judicial department originally part of the Camera Apostolica, which eventually became independent: the tribunal of the <em>Auditor Camerae</em> (henceforth A.C.).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a> It was an ordinary court with immense powers, which enabled it to exercise both the secular and spiritual <em>gladius</em>. Its prerogatives were first defined in 1485 by Innocent VIII, with the bull <em>Apprime ad devotionis</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a></p>\n<p>Its office was composed of a certain number of judges, civil and military lieutenants, and a well-organized notarial structure that eventually comprised up to ten offices. At the end of the 17th century, after Innocent XII’s creation of the so-called <em>Curia Innocentiana</em>, its seat was the Palazzo di Montecitorio.</p>\n<p>The offices of the A.C. were always overloaded with work and their most profitable activity, on which they in fact depended economically, was the writing of contracts <em>in forma Camerae</em> and in their forced execution. Because it was such a profitable activity, various tribunals competed with the A.C. for this privilege.</p>\n<p>In 1513, in order to protect its prerogatives, Leo X indicated the cameral obligations as the exclusive jurisdiction of the A.C. In the motu proprio <em>Iniunctum</em>, he cautioned all other judges against having anything to do with them, under pain of excommunication or monetary penalties.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a>  There was to be only one exception. If questions inherent to a cameral obligation arose in the course of a different trial, then it was allowed that the contract could be executed in that same jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Leo X’s intervention did not prove very successful. He complained just a few years later that the exclusive jurisdiction of the A.C. continued to be undermined through various pretexts.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a></p>\n<p>Other pontifical measures were therefore necessary. Pius IV dealt with the matter in 1561 with the bull <em>Ad eximiae devotionis</em><a href=\"/endnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a> and in 1562 with the bull <em>Inter multiplices</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a> For the first time, he spoke expressly of a <em>privativa</em> (exclusive jurisdiction) over cameral obligations and granted a special privilege to Roman citizens.</p>\n<p>In general, on the basis of what Sixtus IV established in 1473, the court of the Capitoline had jurisdiction over the inhabitants and secular citizens of Rome, and the court of the Papal Vicar over the Roman clerics.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> The cases of cameral obligation were nevertheless reserved for the A.C.</p>\n<p>Pius IV instead gave Romans the possibility of asking for the execution of obligations <em>in forma Camerae</em> at the Capitoline court. The privilege, already granted with the motu proprio <em>Dilectos filios senatorem</em><a href=\"/endnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a> and confirmed with <em>Ad eximiae devotionis</em>,<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> was initially appended to the 1567 edition of the Roman statute and, then, beginning with the Gregorian statute of 1580, its regulations were merged in chapter 41 (<em>De foro competenti</em>) of Book I.</p>\n<p>The privilege of Pius IV was a clear sign of respect for Rome and was confirmed by successive pontiffs. All the same, according to Giovanni Battista De Luca, Romans continued to prefer the highly specialized A.C. for the cameral obligations.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a></p>\n<p>Pius V instead extended jurisdiction over cameral obligations to the tribunal of the Vicar. Initially it was done with the motu proprio <em>Considerantes</em> of 1566, with regard to the clergy and to <em>loca pia</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a></p>\n<p>He returned to it at the time of the reform of the tribunal of the A.C., introduced on November 20, 1570, with the motu proprio <em>Inter illa</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a> While recognizing the exclusive competence of the A.C. regarding the <em>cognitio</em> and <em>executio</em> of the cameral obligations, it established that debtors who were secular Roman citizens could appear before the Capitoline court, whereas the principle of <em>praeventio</em> between A.C. and office of the Vicar would be applied to clergy, whether Roman through birth or benefice: in other words, the first assigned judge would have been able to proceed with the case.</p>\n<p>Paul V confirmed this regulation with the constitution <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-32\"><sup>32</sup></a> According to common opinion, the regulation represented the definitive codification of the material. All the same, after 60 years, the jurisdiction of the Vicar on the cameral obligations started to become the subject of shifting reforms. This situation persisted until 1742, when Benedict XIV, with the constitution <em>Quantum ad procurandam</em>, returned the jurisdiction of the Vicar within the limits fixed by the reform of Paul V.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, as far as the cameral obligations contracted by Roman citizens were concerned, the tribunal of the Vicar was the relevant one for the clergy, and the tribunal of the Senator (the Capitoline court) for the secular <em>cives</em> (citizens).</p>\n<p>The orientation of the jurisprudence of the Roman Rota is to be added to the papal measures regarding jurisdiction over cameral obligations. Over the course of the 17th century, the Roman Rota further limited the exclusive jurisdiction of the A.C. within the Curia, substantially preventing the A.C. from reinstating cases of cameral obligation that had been brought before other tribunals <em>extra Romanam Curiam</em>.</p>\n<p>The exclusive jurisdiction, ultimately, was little respected: it was violated by the tribunal of the Camerlengo and the Camera Apostolica, “prorectors and judges of the basilicas, hospitals, churches, congregations, and pious places,” the magistrates of the guilds and merchants without having any right. And the cameral obligations entered into by prisoners were dealt with by the President of Prisons also after their release.</p>\n<p>Even the <em>Reggente</em> of the Cancelleria considered himself as an ordinary judge in the cases of cameral obligation. Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the A.C., undercut by other Roman judges, was contested also by the Congregazione del Buon Governo, which ended up taking care of the cameral obligations in cases involving debts contracted by the municipalities.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a> In conclusion, it seems that both within and outside the city of Rome, the cameral obligation could be handled by any judge.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a></p>\n<p>Among the great number of acts collected on the site <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635</em> are numerous <em>instrumenta</em> with the formula of cameral obligation rogated (written to be legally binding) by Capitoline notaries.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a> As we saw, Roman citizens could request the execution of cameral obligations from either the A.C. or the Capitoline Curia. We cannot, however, exclude that part of the Accademia’s cameral obligations were handled by the Vicariate given that, as a congregation and in accordance with the Tridentine regulations, it was entrusted by Gregory XIII to the jurisdiction of the Vicar from the start.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a> We also know that in 1606 the Cardinal Vicar Girolamo Pamphili had nominated the jurist Guazzino Guazzini as judge in cases involving members of the Accademia, without however referring expressly to cameral obligations.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":1085,"subtitle":"The Jurisdiction over the Cameral Obligation of the *Auditor Camerae*, the Court of the Capitoline, the Tribunal of the Vicar General, and Others","title":"A Profitable Activity","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/cameral_obligation/II_profitable/"},{"content":"<p>But what, in effect, did the obligation <em>in forma Camerae</em> consist of?</p>\n<p>The cameral obligation started out as a specified series of clauses attached to a contract. The clauses, as a whole, constituted a “formula” to guarantee certain safeguards, above all celerity of execution. In addition, there was the special guarantee of access—either jointly or severally—to an execution against property, a personal execution (incarceration), even a spiritual execution (excommunication).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a> Taken together, these three forms of execution made the cameral obligation an <em>unicum</em> within the larger category of executive instruments of the early modern age, to which it belonged due to the so-called <em>executio parata</em> (a forced execution of debt characterized by particular celerity).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a></p>\n<p>The formula of <em>executio parata</em> rendered the contracts enforceable titles particularly secure for the creditor. In case of noncompliance, it was not necessary to have the credit confirmed by an ordinary civil proceeding; in other words, it was not necessary to verify the situation actually existed between the parties, which was not considered controversial. The possibility of opposing the execution by presenting exceptions or appeals was thus drastically reduced by the debtor’s declared renunciation of the right to do so.</p>\n<p>In the Papal States, the cameral obligation was the true cornerstone of the process of execution. It established the “first and most frequent and most privileged” procedure, to quote the great jurist Giovanni Battista De Luca.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a></p>\n<p>Generally speaking, and taking into account that modifications were introduced over time, the cameral obligation required the debtor to:</p>\n<p>- obligate himself and his heirs, and bind and mortgage all his and his heirs’ assets and property, present and future;<br>\n- submit to any jurisdiction, and principally to the specific one of the A.C.;<br>\n- consent in advance to excommunication and to personal execution (incarceration) up to the full settlement of the credit;<br>\n- renounce resisting the execution in any way;<br>\n- swear to observe and not revoke what is stated in the instrument.</p>\n<p>The other executive instruments used in the medieval period and early modern age (such as the <em>guarentigia, strumento sigillato</em> or <em>confessionato, penes acta</em> obligation, etc.), although in different ways very similar to the cameral obligation, were effective “only” with regard to the patrimony and personal freedom of the debtor.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-42\"><sup>42</sup></a> Transforming the defaulting debtors into excommunicated sinners was an additional and very powerful weapon: it signified not only striking them deep down in their faith, but also destroying their social life. The major excommunication, in fact, separated the debtor from the communion of the church and from the faithful, who were obliged to avoid him. For example, if the debtor was a merchant, the social and commercial consequences could be very serious. According to the <em>stylus</em> of the Curia, bishops, archbishops, patriarchs, and cardinals could not be excommunicated without express mandate of the pope.</p>\n<p>Excommunication for debts was a widespread practice in many European countries, at least until the 16th century.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a> Outside the Papal States, it could be imposed exclusively in the ambit of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but it struck the secular population extremely frequently.</p>\n<p>Juridically, it was based on two conditions. Above all, it was based on the widespread use of confirming contracts and transactions by way of sworn clauses—that is, containing the promise of execution and the sworn commitment not to revoke the contract itself. As for <em>res spiritualis</em>, the oath transferred the contractual material from the competence of civil judges to that of the ecclesiastical judges, regardless of the purpose of the contract.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a> The situation was opposed by the nascent national states in the early modern age, but by the mid-15th century, the celebrated French jurist Guy Pape could affirm that the oath was used in all instruments of obligation (“in omnibus instrumentis obligatoriis adhibetur iuramentum.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a>)</p>\n<p>Therefore, once they were subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the debtors could face excommunication due to their contumacy, understood as <em>contemptus</em>: that is “contempt, scorn, defiance, obstinacy, presumptuousness.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-46\"><sup>46</sup></a> The failed compliance of an order to fulfill was in fact considered “contumacious” disobedience and, according to the rules of canon law, contumacy was the prime cause of excommunication.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a></p>\n<p>The indissoluble relationship between cameral obligation and excommunication was furthermore linked to a disruption of the ordinary <em>iter</em> of execution, which allowed the debtor to be excommunicated immediately, and then to be prosecuted subsequently also with an execution against property and/or personal execution, jointly or severally, depending on the creditor’s preference. In other words, the execution against the debtor’s assets came last. Instead, the ordinary executive procedure began with the enforced expropriation of movable assets, then immovable assets, then the assets of the guarantors, to progress finally to the personal execution.</p>\n<p>The Council of Trent radically changed the configuration of the cameral obligation, modifying its main characteristic. If excommunication previously took precedence over other forms of enforcement, the Tridentine decrees in the 25th session of the reform had established a criterion of moderation in imposing excommunication, stating that for civil cases it could intervene only in the case of difficulty of personal enforcement or foreclosure.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-48\"><sup>48</sup></a> Therefore, it was now the imposing of excommunication that came after the execution against freedom and property.</p>\n<p>In 1570 the constitution <em>Inter illa</em> of Pius V adopted the decree of the Council of Trent, and beginning with this disposition the cameral obligation entered the second phase of its history, the “modern” phase.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-49\"><sup>49</sup></a></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":878,"title":"The *Executio Parata* of Cameral Obligations and Excommunication","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/cameral_obligation/III_executioparata/"},{"content":"<p>The broad diffusion of the cameral formula in contracts and the speed of the procedure created an enormous amount of work that, in effect, fell almost entirely on the shoulders of the notaries.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-50\"><sup>50</sup></a> They often carried out the work of the judges, who in some cases did no more than sign their names on a blank sheet, which the notaries then transformed into judicial decisions. Sallustio Tiberi said, with reference to these judgments in particular, “notarii debent esse oculi Iudicis” (notaries should be the eyes of the judge).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-51\"><sup>51</sup></a></p>\n<p>The procedure <em>in forma Camerae</em> started in the presence of a notary. In rogating a contract of a mortgage, a lease, a census, or in any case relating to a monetary obligation, the notary inserted the typical clauses, which allowed the <em>executio parata</em>. His work accompanied every step of the executive procedure.</p>\n<p>Unlike instruments with a clause of <em>guarentigia</em>, which already contained the act of precept, in the case of cameral obligations no jurisdiction was formally delegated to the notary.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-52\"><sup>52</sup></a> The executive mandates were under the jurisdiction of the judge and papal legislation did not foresee exceptions to this principle. The intense and repetitive routine of the execution of obligations <em>in forma Camerae</em>, however, made it impossible that every judicial decision necessary to complete the various phases of the procedure could be effectively carried out by the judge according to the required formalities.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the majority of the acts were in fact completed by the notaries of the tribunal.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-53\"><sup>53</sup></a> Only in special cases, in which the intervention of judicial authority was absolutely indispensable—for example, when issuing definitive decrees—was the requirement of the written form <em>ad nullitatem</em> (i.e., without which the act is null and void) fulfilled by the signature of the judge below the annotation which the notary had made in his <em>broliardo</em>, the <em>Liber actorum notariorum</em>.</p>\n<p>Over time, the <em>stylus</em> of the tribunal regarding the execution of the cameral obligations underwent substantial modification. The most significant changes resulted in an increased autonomy for the actuary notaries (that is, the notaries of the tribunal), which meant that the auditor, for his part, had to place an increased trust in them.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-54\"><sup>54</sup></a></p>\n<p>Indicative of this great trust was the fact that the A.C. and his civil lieutenants regularly signed documents that only subsequently were transformed by notaries into judicial decisions. In practice, therefore, it was the notarial offices that issued—depending on the requirements—warnings or executive mandates, even ecclesiastical censures, without having to turn to the judge again.</p>\n<p>Where possible, the notary guided the procedure, integrating the missing elements. In time, the integrations became permanent and conformed to a style.</p>\n<p>For example, the imposition of censures initially occurred by means of a formula, written by one of the judges of the tribunal in his own hand below the obligation or added to the notary’s annotation in his <em>broliardo</em>. With the passing of time, however, it became established for judges, during any audience, to limit themselves to signing what the notary had written in his <em>brogliardo</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-55\"><sup>55</sup></a></p>\n<p>Similarly, the notary would (falsely) indicate the procurator’s confession of debt—which was supposed to have taken place before a judge of the A.C.—together with the procurator’s presence at the time the contract was concluded, as having occurred, when in fact these requirements were evaded in order to avoid a chaotic situation in the already crowded offices.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-56\"><sup>56</sup></a></p>\n<p>It was, in the final analysis, the practical needs that actually determined the proceedings, and it was up to the notaries to address them accordingly.

In civil cases, excommunication could only be imposed <em>in iuris subsidium</em>—that is, when it is not possible to proceed to an execution against property or a personal execution.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-57\"><sup>57</sup></a></p>\n<p>The procedure of the execution of the cameral obligation in use until circa 1570 was called the <em>stylus antiquus</em>. The passage to the <em>stylus modernus</em> occurred formally with the constitution <em>Inter illa</em>, but in reality the transition was not abrupt because the innovations had been preceded by a debate among jurists regarding certain questions, and some of them had already been effectuated in practice.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-58\"><sup>58</sup></a>  The new form of the cameral obligation was secured by the constitution <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612), in which Paul V recommended that the <em>stylus hodiernus</em> be observed in the execution of the cameral obligations. It differed from the outdated <em>forma antiqua</em> in several ways, which were indicated by the pope: (1) the possibility of a single summons; (2) the obligation regarding the heirs; (3) the failed appearance of the procurators; (4) the lack of the <em>susceptio censurarum</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-59\"><sup>59</sup></a></p>\n<p>It is worth emphasizing that, after 1570, the two styles never coexisted; the most recent style supplanted the old one.

According to De Luca, the modern formula of the cameral obligation, characterized by a greater range of clauses (“maiorem clausularum amplitudinem”), had resolved all the interpretive doubts that the old formula had left open, and it avoided the possibility of new doubts arising.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-60\"><sup>60</sup></a> Above all, it simplified the procedure because it abolished superfluous formalities which served only to support dilatory strategies and were therefore a hindrance to commerce.</p>\n<p>The many cameral obligations that we find in the notarial documents relating to the Accademia di San Luca, conserved in the Archivio di Stato di Roma, belong to the period after 1570: they therefore follow the <em>stylus modernus</em>. They are recognizable as such because for the most part the acts concern obligations <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em>, an expression indicating the use of the modern style. Furthermore, they refer to the responsibility of the heirs. For greater clarity, we shall therefore describe the executive procedure connected with the obligation <em>in forma Camerae</em>, explaining the particular characteristics of the <em>stylus modernus</em>, occasionally referring to what the procedure had been before the reform.</p>\n<p><strong>a. The Instrument: <em>Repetitio, Recognitio</em> and <em>Extensio Formulae</em> before and after the Reform</strong></p>\n<p>The obligation <em>in forma Camerae</em> could be found in a public as well as a private instrument. The public form was not necessary for the contract to be valid, but it permitted a swifter execution.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the greatest degree of certainty, and therefore of trustworthiness, was provided by the public instrument rogated by an actuary notary.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-61\"><sup>61</sup></a> It was also customary for the notarial offices of the A.C. to append the clauses of cameral obligation in most contracts involving a monetary obligation, to the point that in the Papal States, the cameral formula was presumed to have been affixed, even when not expressly indicated. There were few exceptions: for example, in Bologna, where it was not customary to oblige <em>in forma Camerae</em>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if the contract had been rogated by an actuary notary, it was presumed that the clause was not only affixed, but also correctly drawn up. Therefore, it was not required to verify the act, and the debtor could be summoned immediately.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>stylus antiquus</em>, however, if the instrument had been rogated by a different notary, it would have to be produced before an actuary notary, who could limit himself to carrying out a <em>repetitio</em> before moving on to the summons. Or, if the first notary had in some way abbreviated the clauses, which happened often, or if it was a private instrument, the actuary notary would have to have proceeded to the so-called <em>extensio</em> of the formula in order to make the instrument conform in every way to the cameral obligation in use. For this purpose, the notary had to carry out a <em>recognitio</em>, also by way of the sworn testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p>The <em>extensio</em> consisted in the insertion of all the general clauses considered essential in the contract <em>in forma Camerae</em> (with the exception of the oath), and the Roman Rota regarded it necessary under pain of nullity.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-62\"><sup>62</sup></a> It was followed by the A.C.’s <em>decretum de extendendo</em>.</p>\n<p>The extension was much discussed. It was the source of dispute regarding procedures for enacting it and the occasion for dilatory strategies on the part of the debtor. De Luca considered it an example of those “useless formalities of which antiquity was so fond.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-63\"><sup>63</sup></a></p>\n<p>In fact, the <em>stylus modernus</em>, which called for a swifter procedure, had in part abandoned it: whoever had obliged themselves <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em> (that is, according to the <em>modern stylus</em>) with a public instrument—even if not rogated by notaries of the A.C.—would not need to be summoned by the extensio of the formula. It sufficed for him to have agreed to the executive mandate <em>unica vel sine citatione</em> (with a single summons or without), and in this case he was summoned only once, directly <em>ad solvendum</em> (for the fulfillment). The possibility of avoiding the extension did not regard contracts in private form, and it was excluded if there was a change in the subjects of the obligation (<em>personae mutatae</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>b. The Summonses</strong></p>\n<p>Once the instrument was verified, the debtor was summoned. Normally the summons of a debtor who resided in Rome was delivered personally (<em>personaliter</em>) or through posting (<em>per affixionem cedulae</em>) on the housedoor. In the first case, the summons could be for the same day (<em>hodie per totam</em>, that is at the time of the hearing), in the second, it was for the following day (<em>ad primam</em>).</p>\n<p>If the debtor did not reside in Rome and turned out to be <em>absens</em>, then the creditor, after a brief search, swore in the city to the absence of the debtor, and the oath in itself constituted proof of the absence. However, in order to proceed <em>in absentia</em>, the credit had to be liquid—that, is the total amount had to be established. If not, it would have to have been established by witnesses prior to the taking of the oath.</p>\n<p>In this case, the summons could take place <em>per audientiam contradictarum</em>, if it happened to be the period of hearings, or <em>per affixionem</em> on the door of the Curia of the auditor or in some other usual place, if it happened to be the period of <em>vacatio</em>. The <em>audientia contradictarum</em> was a type of summons used with regard to all contumacious absent from Urbe (“omnes contumaces ab Urbe absentes.”)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-64\"><sup>64</sup></a> The summonses were read by the <em>notarius contradictarum</em> in a public place during the <em>dies iuridici</em> (i.e., the period of hearings); during the <em>tempus vacationum</em>, the <em>contradictae</em> were instead posted.</p>\n<p>Under the <em>stylus antiquus</em>, the debtor received several summonses. If the obligation was inserted in an act that required the extension of the formula, the debtor was summoned <em>ad dicendum contra iura</em>. In the actual executive phase, the summons of the debtor occurred firstly in the ways just described; a second time with excommunication and the issuance of the <em>litterae declaratoriae</em>; a third time for aggravation, re-aggravation, and invocation of the secular arm; and a fourth time for the initiation of forced execution.</p>\n<p>The procedure was carried out at an extremely fast pace, so that—if the debtor resided in Rome and was <em>praesens</em> (present), and deferment had not been granted—it took 15 days at the most to arrive at the stage of enforced expropriation. The actions that were carried out during the course of this brief period were numerous, even relentless, for the debtor. All in all, the debtor’s presence was requested for two specific purposes: to discharge, confess, or see the debt confessed and to be excommunicated.</p>\n<p>If the debtor obliged himself according to the <em>stylus modernus</em>, consenting to the executive mandate <em>unica vel sine citatione</em>, he was summoned only one time, directly <em>ad solvendum</em>. Once the debtor appeared in court, he received the notice to comply. Provided there were no relevant exceptions, the executive mandate was released at the same time. If instead the debtor had agreed to a <em>bina citatio</em> (double summons), the mandate would have been released in the second and final hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Confession of Debt and Excommunication</strong></p>\n<p>Confession of debt and excommunication characterized the <em>stylus antiquus</em>. Once the time limit imposed by the first summons had elapsed, the confession of the debt was carried out at the request of the creditor by one of the procurators indicated in the instrument for the amount stated in the same instrument.</p>\n<p>After the confession of debt had been carried out at the request of the creditor, the judge declared that if the debtor had not complied within three days (<em>nisi infra tres dies</em>), he would be sentenced to excommunication. However, within that three-day time limit, he had the possibility of raising relevant objections from among the few conceded in the obligation <em>in forma Camerae</em>.</p>\n<p>Assuming that the three days passed without fulfillment (although the deadline could be delayed for up to 30 days), the judge, in the presence of the creditor or his procurator, declared the debtor excommunicated if he had failed to comply by the end of that same day. If the day passed without any steps being taken, the so-called <em>litterae declaratoriae</em> were issued. The <em>declaratoriae</em> were not needed for the commination of excommunication (which had already been declared with the formula <em>nisi infra tres dies satisfecerit</em>), but rather for its publication and the social consequences it entailed. As is known, whoever was excommunicated was forsaken by the faithful.</p>\n<p>It is worth underlining that the <em>tres dies</em> indicated by the judge were equivalent to the triple admonition (<em>trina monitio</em>) requested by canon law before imposing the excommunication. In this way, the two juridical bases of excommunication—contumacy and <em>monitiones</em>—were formally preserved.</p>\n<p>The <em>declaratoriae</em> were written by an actuary notary, delivered to the plaintiff, and posted by a cursor (process server) of the tribunal in Campo de’ Fiori to make it publicly known that the debtor was excommunicated. If ten days passed without fulfillment, the debtor was summoned another time for <em>aggravatio, reaggravatio</em>, and <em>auxilium brachii saecularis</em>. Essentially, at the hearing, the judge increased the censures, invoking the aid of the secular arm, and issued the “aggravatory letters.” These letters contained both the order to obtain goods from the debtor’s patrimony to the value of the debt with the intention of selling them at auction and to incarcerate the debtor until the entire debt was fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to these letters, notices written in capital letters were posted around the city. Images deformed and unseemly (“deformes atque indecorae”) were drawn in various colors at the tops of the notices, vilifying the debtors.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-65\"><sup>65</sup></a></p>\n<p>The <em>stylus hodiernus</em> no longer required the constitution of the procurators for the confession of the debt (<em>ad confitendum debitum</em>). It was a significant transformation of the procedure because up to that moment the confession in court of the debt (<em>confessio in iure</em>), a very old element of the cameral obligation, had been decisive for its validity. The constitution <em>Inter illa</em> had established instead that the procurator could be appointed for the confession of the debt only if he had been nominated by the defendant also for his defense and had not accepted the request. The disposition had been confirmed by the bull <em>Universi agri dominici</em> in 1612. In the same year, Sigismondo Scaccia attested that the constitution of the procurator had by then disappeared from judicial practice. Furthermore, the judicial confession of debt had disappeared. Scaccia maintained that if, after the reform, there was still trace of it in instruments provided with the cameral obligation, it would most likely have been fictitious.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-66\"><sup>66</sup></a></p>\n<p><strong>d. Execution against Property and Personal Execution</strong></p>\n<p>After excommunication (according to the <em>stylus antiquus</em>), or before or in its absence (according to the <em>stylus modernus</em>), it was possible to proceed against the debtor with an execution against property and/or personal execution, jointly or severally, depending on the creditor’s preference. The debtor had the power to avoid or halt the executive procedure at any time by consigning the amount owed, in cash, to the executors.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-67\"><sup>67</sup></a></p>\n<p>The personal execution led to incarceration and in theory could apply to any debtor. In fact, it affected the most defenseless social classes because judges customarily spared prelates, barons, illustrious men, and “honest women” from being arrested.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-68\"><sup>68</sup></a> Imprisonment ceased only after paying the debt (<em>soluto debito</em>), or after the deposit of appropriate bail.</p>\n<p>The execution against movable property occurred by seizing the property from the house of the debtor (or from another place) and its deposit. Following the institution by Urban VIII in 1625, the seized property was deposited at the Depositaria urbana dei pubblici pegni.</p>\n<p>In the case of immovable property, seizure was carried out by way of <em>accessio ad domum</em> and potentially <em>ad vineam</em> (entrance into the house or vineyard) of the debtor, in the presence of witnesses, the executor, and the actuary notary of the lawsuit, who wrote the minutes.</p>\n<p>Once seizure of the movable and immovable property was completed at the request of the creditor, the debtor was summoned to receive the order to consign the money in partial or total fulfillment of the credit, by decree <em>nisi ad primam diem</em>, that is within one day. If the brief time limit elapsed without response, the executors received the mandate to consign the properties to the cursors for sale at auction.</p>\n<p>Having received the goods, the cursors described them in a voucher and then arranged for the auction. After the goods were sold to the highest bidder, if the creditor considered the proceeds insufficient, it was customary for the Curia to move ahead to a further execution—either against property or personal execution—pursuant to the first mandate, until the credit was fully repaid.</p>\n<p><strong>e. The Exceptions and <em>Vulneratio</em></strong></p>\n<p>The formula of the cameral obligation called for the invocation of exceptions and appeals to be renounced. All the same, it was generally accepted that three exceptions—<em>falsitas, solutio</em>, and <em>quietatio</em>—could serve to oppose the cameral obligations. These were not peremptory, however. Others were allowed on the basis of their relevance, but above all on the condition that they did not obstruct or delay execution.</p>\n<p>Certain exceptions could not, in fact, be evaded: the ones based on the <em>incompetentia iudicis</em>, on the <em>inhabilitas</em> of the plaintiff (for example, because he was a minor, exiled, or excommunicated) or on his nonfulfillment (<em>res non tradita, pretium non solutum</em>), and on the nullity of the instrument.</p>\n<p>In general, according to doctrine and jurisprudence, a few exceptions could simply be rejected; others delayed the prosecution of the process because their admissibility was immediately evident from the reading of the instrument, by known fact, or by the nature of the thing (for example, <em>res non tradita, res non libere tradita</em>, etc.). Exceptions that were not immediately ascertainable but required further research, for example for witnesses, could be rejected in order not to delay the execution.</p>\n<p>This general criterion left space for a casuistry of admissible exceptions. The execution however always had to be interrupted in case of <em>vulneratio</em>, that is to say when a debtor’s sentence or an arbitration ruling of acquittal intervened. The <em>vulnerata</em> obligation lost the <em>executio parata</em> and always became open to appeal. The appeal, however, constituted the only recourse for the creditor, who then had to wait for the three consistent judgments.</p>\n<p>It was with some hostility that not only writers of treatises but also the law regarded the hypothesis that a certain event—even a fact as important as the acquittal of the debtor—could obstruct or interrupt the executive procedure. De Luca did not disguise the fact that he considered the acquittal a “serious injury” to the creditor and warned the judges “not to be uncertain and easy to absolve.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-69\"><sup>69</sup></a></p>\n<p><strong>f. The Obligation with Regard to the Heirs</strong></p>\n<p>At the time of the <em>stylus antiquus</em>, it was debated if the cameral obligation would be transferred to the heirs.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-70\"><sup>70</sup></a> It was uncontested that the obligation would be transferred in its entirety to the heirs of the creditor. However, there were many doubts regarding the heirs of the debtor, above all because the cameral obligation consisted of a sworn obligation and the heirs would have perjured themselves for an oath that they had not personally sworn, or would even have incurred excommunication. But the question that seemed central and a hindrance to the transmission of the obligation to the heirs was that of the mandate to the procurators.</p>\n<p>The cameral formula, according to the <em>stylus antiquus</em>, in fact included the constitution of procurators, with the mandate to confess the debt in the name and on behalf of the debtor for the amount indicated in the contract, and it was deemed that the mandate must be considered revoked upon death of the debtor. Nonetheless, in the mid-16th century, the Segnatura di Giustizia had reached the conclusion, which was then adopted as standard practice, to consider the properties of the deceased debtor executable since the mandate, being inserted in the cameral contract <em>ad alterius commodum</em> (i.e., for the benefit of the other party), could not be tacitly revoked upon death of the debtor.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-71\"><sup>71</sup></a></p>\n<p>In the following years, after the reform of the cameral obligation of 1570, the solution indicated by the Segnatura di Giustizia was reinforced by the failure of the constitution of the procurators. Therefore, the transmissibility to the heirs, on which the doctrine had hesitated since 1555, proceeded to become a typical feature of the <em>stylus modernus</em>. It was indicated as such in the constitution <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612).</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":2970,"subtitle":"Stylus Antiquus and Modernus","title":"The Procedure before and after 1570","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/cameral_obligation/V_procedure/"},{"content":"<p>The great fortune of the cameral obligation was based on the fact that it allowed for a very swift execution, freeing the creditor not only from waiting for the conclusion of an ordinary process, that is the verification of the debt, but also from any delay deriving from the opposition that the debtor could have raised in the realization of an ordinary procedure of execution.</p>\n<p>It was an entirely preferential execution, whose swiftness and efficiency, however, were completely to the disadvantage of the debtor. He swore to comply, making himself liable to perjury and pledging not only all his properties, present and future, but also the present and future properties of his heirs, his personal freedom. He even risked excommunication. He subjected himself to the jurisdiction of any judge and accepted that the executive mandate against him was issued immediately following a single summons. He renounced obstructing the execution not only with exceptions and appeals but also with any advantage foreseen by the law, and—except in the extremely rare case of acquittal—he could avoid execution only with fulfillment.</p>\n<p>In assuming such a serious obligation, he was not always well informed of the responsibilities deriving therefrom; in their instruments, notaries habitually abbreviated the formula of the cameral obligation to the point of rendering it incomprehensible and unrecognizable for anyone who did not already know it. If Antonio Massa, in the 16th century, maintained that the cameral obligation was known to all, including women and peasants, in reality—and in time—the fact of taking for granted information regarding the gravity of the obligations that had been entered upon became increasingly vexatious for the debtor.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-72\"><sup>72</sup></a> Beginning in the 18th century—by which time the cultural and judicial climate regarding the cameral obligation had changed dramatically—this aspect was often denounced and lamented by jurists: the notaries informed the parties, and particularly those assuming the obligations <em>in forma Camerae</em> “with the greatest circumspection.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-73\"><sup>73</sup></a></p>\n<p>Considering that the notaries’ habit of radically abbreviating the formula—also in the numerous documents of the Accademia di San Luca that have been digitized and transcribed for this project—makes it difficult to recognize the cameral obligations and their content, it seems useful to provide some suggestions for identifying them.</p>\n<p>Below are brief indications for recognizing the formula of the cameral obligation in the notarial instruments of the Accademia (and for facilitating research in the database of <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca</em>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the incipit of the formula is always <em>Pro quibus</em>;</li>\n<li>the formula has the expression <em>in forma Camerae Apostolicae</em>, but often, for obligations in the <em>stylus modernus</em> (after 1570), the wording used is <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em>: this would imply that, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the obligation will be transferred to the heirs also <em>ex parte debitoris</em>;</li>\n<li>for this reason, reference is made to <em>haeredes</em> and <em>bona</em>;</li>\n<li>the formula is always abbreviated <em>cum clausulis solitis etc.</em>;</li>\n<li>waivers (to appeals, exceptions) are indicated;</li>\n<li>the consent to a single (<em>unica</em>) summons is indicated;</li>\n<li>the formula closes with reference to an oath.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, allowing for minor differences between one notary and another, the abbreviated formula was approximately as follows:</p>\n<p>Pro quibus <em>etc.</em> se <em>etc.</em> heredes <em>etc</em>. bona omnia etc. in ampliori forma Camerae Apostolicae <em>cum clausulis solitis etc.</em> citra <em>etc.</em> renuncians <em>etc.</em> obligavit ac mandat<em>um etc.</em> unica <em>etc.</em> et tactis iuravit Super quibus etc.</p>\n<p>In content, this abbreviation corresponds to the following formula of the <em>stylus modernus</em> of the cameral obligation, for which reference is normally made to the text published by Silvestro Zacchia in the <em>Lucubrationes ad Gallesium de obligatione Camerali, quibus praeter additiones eiusdem Authoris . . . accesserunt aliae Lanfranchi Zacchiae I.U.D.</em> (Rome, 1647):<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-74\"><sup>74</sup></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pro quibus omnibus, et singulis praemissis tenendis, complendis et inviolabiliter observandis idem A. debitor se ipsum, suosque haeredes, ac successores quoscumque, ac bona sua, et suorum quaecunque tam praesentia, et futura tam mobilia quam immobilia, ubilibet existentia iura, actiones, et debitorum nomina in ampliori forma Camerae dicto B. praesenti, et acceptanti, et pro se, suisque haeredibus, et successoribus quibuscunque stipulanti, et recipienti obligavit et hypotecavit, nec non Curiae causarum Camerae Apostolicae eiusque Camerarii, Vicecamerarii, Auditoris, Viceauditoris, Regentis, Locumtenentis, et Commissarii, ac omnium et singularum aliarum Curiarum Ecclesiasticarum, et secularium ubilibet constitutarum iurisdictionibus, coercionibus, compulsionibus, iuribus, rigoribus, stilis, et meris examinibus supposuit, et submisit, per quas curias, et earum quamlibet tam coniunctim, quam divisim, voluit, et expresse consensit se, ac suos haeredes, et successores praedictos posse realiter, ac personaliter cogi, compelli, astringi, excommunicari, aggravari, reaggravari, et ad brachium seculare deponi, arrestari, capi, incarcerari, et detineri uno et eodem tempore, vel diversis temporibus, et per diversorum temporum intervalla usque ad plenariam, et integram praemissorum observationem, ac omnium et singulorum damnorum, expensarum, et interesse praemissorum occasione forsan faciendorum, et substinendorum integram refectionem, et restitutionem, ita tamen quod executio unius Curiae executionem alterius non impediat, nec retardet, non obstante iuris dispositione, quod ubi iudicium incęptum est, ibidem terminari debeat, et quod causarum continentiae non dividantur, et quod quis teneatur in ea actione, quam intentavit usque ad finem litis persisteret, et qualibet alia iuris, et facti exceptione in contrarium facente, non obstante, et quavis alia iuris, seu facti exceptione, quae posset alligari in contrarium facente, non obstante;

The most famous of these instruments, because of its medieval origin and its diffusion, is the <em>guarentigia</em>. Every legal system of the Italian peninsula had its own particular executive pactum; if the <em>guarentigia</em>, mentioned by the medieval <em>doctores</em>, originated in Tuscany, Piedmont had the <em>strumento sigillato</em>, the Marche the instrument <em>ad voluntatem</em>, other regions the instrument <em>confessionato</em>, the Kingdom of Naples the obligation <em>penes acta</em>, and the Papal States the cameral obligation. Unlike other executive instruments used in various regions or states, the <em>executio parata</em> of the sworn, confessed, and guaranteed instruments were recognized on a broader level according to Roman canonical <em>ius commune</em>. On these subjects, see Antonio Pertile, <em>Storia del diritto italiano dalla caduta dell’Impero romano alla codificazione</em>, VI.2, in <em>Storia della procedura</em>, ed. P.

Nonetheless, on the basis of the confession and with the consensus of the parties, in the guaranteed instrument the notary addressed the order to comply directly at the debtor by way of a <em>praeceptum</em> incorporated in the act. Formally this was made possible by an equalization of the <em>confessio</em> to the judgment, but it also entailed attributing the power of jurisdiction to the notary, which not all systems allowed. The Papal States did not recognize any formal delegation of jurisdiction to notaries.

style=\"text-align: center;\">Premessa</p></h1>\n<p>L’obbligazione camerale, o <em>in forma Camerae</em>, è un istituto giuridico poco noto, anche agli storici del diritto, ma adottato con altissima frequenza nello Stato Pontificio nel corso dell’età moderna<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-1\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nello Stato della Chiesa, infatti, la formula di obbligazione camerale era apposta in tutti i contratti nei quali vi fosse, da parte di almeno uno dei contraenti, un’obbligazione di tipo pecuniario, ma veniva usata a più ampio spettro, in tutti quei casi nei quali si voleva certezza e celerità dell’adempimento.</p>\n<p>“In Statu Ecclesiastico fere semper stipulantur contractus sub obligatione Camerali”, affermava una <em>decisio</em> della Rota nel 1644<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Si può aggiungere, per esemplificare la sua importanza, che la magnifica Roma rinascimentale e barocca è stata realizzata stringendo con artisti e maestranze contratti a vario titolo costellati di obbligazioni <em>in forma Camerae</em>.</p>\n<p>Nell’ambito artistico emerge infatti con grande chiarezza l’estrema rilevanza dell’obbligo camerale nel regolare i rapporti giuridici, sia tra i privati che tra la committenza pubblica e i privati.</p>\n<p>Solo per fare alcuni esempi, basati su contratti che ci sono noti, per la tomba di Giulio II Michelangelo Buonarroti fu ingaggiato con obbligazione camerale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>; con la stessa formula si impegnarono Caravaggio, per opere da eseguire in San Luigi dei Francesi<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> e in Santa Maria del Popolo<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>, Nicolas Cordier per la statua in bronzo di Enrico IV di Francia nella basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>, Rubens per il trittico dell’altare maggiore della Chiesa Nuova<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>. Per la cupola della Sapienza, che si temeva troppo pesante, Francesco Borromini prestò garanzia impegnandosi con obbligazione camerale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Anche i documenti trascritti e digitalizzati nel progetto di ricerca della National Gallery of Art, <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma</em>, testimoniano quanto frequente fosse il ricorso all’obbligazione camerale nei rapporti giuridici che fondavano l’attività degli artisti romani.</p>\n<p>Lo statuto dell’Accademia prevedeva che qualsiasi “imprestanza” agli associati (mutuo o comodato) dovesse essere formalizzata con obbligazione camerale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a>. Ma erano moltissime le tipologie di obblighi assunti in forma camerale: locazioni, fideiussioni, censi, ecc. <em>In forma Camerae</em> gli artisti si obbligavano anche alla tassa sulle stime, ovvero al pagamento all’Accademia del 2% del valore stimato dell’opera: infatti, quella che gli Statuti chiamavano la  <em>Forma della Polliza da farsi &amp; sottoscriversi da quelli che vorranno le stime</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>, trova nei documenti notariali espressione come obbligazione camerale. Tra le molte<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a>, c’è ad esempio quella di Guido Reni, che nel 1609 promette il 2% di quanto riceverà per i lavori fatti al Palazzo Apostolico, ancora da stimarsi<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a>. Nel 1607, il curato della Chiesa di San Luca, Andrea Glacisco, dopo aver ricevuto l’inventario dei beni mobili reperiti nella sacrestia della chiesa, si obbligava con forma camerale a darne conto a qualsiasi richiesta dell’Accademia<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a>. <em>In forma Camerae</em> i membri della congregazione segreta si obbligarono nel 1621 al rispetto del breve di Gregorio XV che aveva confermato gli Statuti dell’Accademia<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a>. O ancora, i deputati della Congregazione dei Pittori si impegnarono con formula camerale a far celebrare delle messe in suffragio nella Chiesa di San Luca<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>. Gli esempi potrebbero moltiplicarsi.</p>\n<p>Nelle pagine che seguono si cercherà di illustrare (1) le origini e la storia dell’obbligazione camerale; (2) a chi spettasse la giurisdizione su di essa; (3) in cosa consistesse l’executio parata che essa garantiva e in che modo fosse collegata a una scomunica; (4) quale fosse il ruolo dei notai nella procedura (5) quali fossero le modalità dell’esecuzione. A questo proposito si cercheranno di evidenziare le differenze tra lo <em>stylus antiquus</em> dell’obbligazione <em>in forma Camerae</em> (ante 1570), e lo <em>stylus modernus</em>, adottato in modo esclusivo nei documenti dell’Accademia. Infine, nelle Conclusioni, si darà qualche indicazione su come riconoscere la formula camerale negli atti notarili. Un’appendice (verosimilmente non esaustiva) fornirà un elenco di documenti dell’Accademia—presenti nel database del sito della National Gallery of Art—in cui essa è riprodotta in forma abbreviata.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Immagine in alto: Archivio di Stato di Roma, TCS, Vol. 0551, 1637, fol. 387v (detail)</em></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":659,"title":"L'obbligazione camerale nei documenti dell'Accademia di San Luca","type":"splash","url":"http://localhost:8080/obbligazione_camerale/"},{"content":"<p>L’obbligazione camerale o <em>in forma Camerae</em> prende il nome dalla Camera Apostolica, il dicastero preposto alla gestione finanziaria ed economica della Santa Sede. Inizialmente, infatti, era stata creata a garanzia dei crediti camerali che consistevano per lo più in annate, cioè tasse gravanti sui benefici ecclesiastici sparsi ovunque nel mondo. La soddisfazione di questi crediti, di natura fiscale, era complicata per due ragioni. Innanzi tutto, per l’oggettiva difficoltà di ottenere un’esecuzione forzata in regioni lontane e sottoposte a giurisdizioni estranee. In secondo luogo, perché molti debitori non pagavano tempestivamente, ma preferivano attendere di essere condannati da tre sentenze conformi: dopo le quali, secondo il Diritto comune, non si potevano più presentare appelli e la decisione passava in giudicato.</p>\n<p>Il rimedio adottato, di cui dà già testimonianza Guglielmo Durante nello <em>Speculum Iudiciale</em> (ca. 1290)<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a>, era efficacissimo nell’ovviare ad entrambi i problemi: si faceva giurare all’obbligato di adempiere entro un certo termine o altrimenti rinunciare a qualsiasi eccezione o appello; poi, lo si ammoniva che, in caso di mancato adempimento, sarebbe stato automaticamente scomunicato. In questo modo, attraverso il suo vescovo, il debitore poteva essere colpito dalla scomunica ovunque si trovasse.</p>\n<p>Questa procedura fu molto criticata durante il Concilio di Costanza, all’inizio del ’400, per il suo carattere vessatorio, data l’indubbia sproporzione di forze tra chi la imponeva e chi la subiva. Venne definita violenta, contraria al diritto, addirittura simoniaca<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Dopo il Concilio, il pagamento delle imposte beneficiali venne regolato dalla Chiesa in base a concordati con i singoli Stati: questo comportò un uso più limitato delle obbligazioni camerali che, a partire dal Cinquecento, vennero impiegate prevalentemente nei contratti tra privati.</p>\n<p>La vita dell’obbligazione camerale fu lunga, e si concluse solo agli inizi del XIX secolo: il Codice di procedura civile di Pio VII, del 1817, abolì gli effetti della clausola per l’avvenire. Questo provvedimento, pur confermato da Leone XII (1824) e da Gregorio XVI (1831), non fu però inserito nel <em>Regolamento di procedura nei giudizi civili</em> del 1834, che abrogava espressamente i codici precedenti: per questo motivo, ancora per qualche tempo dopo la sua promulgazione si continuarono a promuovere cause derivanti da contratti stipulati con formula camerale, il cui effetto fu dichiarato cessato definitivamente solo nel 1843<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":365,"title":"Le origini dell’obbligazione camerale","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/obbligazione_camerale/I_Origini/"},{"content":"<p>La procedura esecutiva che nasceva dai contratti dotati di formula camerale era riservata – almeno teoricamente – alla giurisdizione di un organo giudiziario nato da una costola della Camera Apostolica, e poi divenuto indipendente: il tribunale dell’<em>Auditor Camerae</em> (d’ora in poi A.C.)<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a>. Era un giudice ordinario dotato di poteri immensi, tanto da esercitare sia il gladio secolare che quello spirituale. Le sue prerogative vennero definite per la prima volta nel 1485 da Innocenzo VIII, con la bolla <em>Apprime ad devotionis</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Il suo ufficio era composto di un certo numero di giudici, luogotenenti civili e militari, e da un’articolata struttura notarile che arrivò a comprendere fino a dieci uffici. La sede era, dopo la creazione da parte di Innocenzo XII alla fine del Seicento della cd. <em>Curia Innocentiana</em>, il palazzo di Montecitorio.</p>\n<p>Gli uffici dell’A.C. erano sempre oberati di lavoro e la loro attività più remunerativa, da cui di fatto dipendevano economicamente, consisteva proprio nella redazione dei contratti <em>in forma Camerae</em> e nella loro esecuzione forzata. Proprio perché si trattava di un’attività molto redditizia, diversi tribunali contesero all’A.C. questo privilegio.</p>\n<p>Per salvaguardare le prerogative dell’A.C., nel 1513 Leone X indicò la giurisdizione sulle obbligazioni camerali come esclusiva dell’<em>Auditor Camerae</em>. Nel <em>motu proprio Iniunctum</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a> egli diffidava qualsiasi altro giudice dall’occuparsene, sotto pena di scomunica e di sanzioni pecuniarie. L’unica deroga era prevista per l’eventualità che questioni inerenti un’obbligazione camerale fossero sorte nel corso di un diverso processo, ed allora era concesso che in quella stessa sede giudiziaria il contratto avesse anche esecuzione.</p>\n<p>L’intervento di Leone X ebbe però poco successo: lo stesso papa lamentò dopo pochi anni che, con diversi pretesti, la giurisdizione esclusiva dell’A.C. continuava ad essere insidiata<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Furono perciò necessari ulteriori provvedimenti pontifici. Pio IV se ne occupò nel 1561 con la costituzione <em>Ad eximiae devotionis</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a> e nel 1562 con la costituzione <em>Inter multiplices</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a> Per la prima volta parlò espressamente di “privativa” sulle obbligazioni camerali e concesse uno speciale privilegio ai romani.</p>\n<p>In via generale, infatti, in base a quanto stabilito da Sisto IV nel 1473<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a>, la giurisdizione sugli abitanti e i cittadini laici di Roma era della Curia del Senatore, e che quella sui chierici romani del Vicario papale. Le cause di obbligazione camerale erano però riservate all’A.C.</p>\n<p>Pio IV, invece, concesse ai romani la possibilità di chiedere l’esecuzione delle obbligazioni <em>in forma Camerae</em> anche dinanzi alla Curia capitolina. Il privilegio, già accordato con il motu proprio <em>Dilectos filios senatorem</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> e confermato nella <em>Ad eximiae devotionis</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a>, venne inizialmente aggiunto in appendice all’edizione dello Statuto romano del 1567, poi, a partire dallo Statuto gregoriano del 1580, le sue disposizioni confluirono nel cap. 41 (<em>De foro competenti</em>) del libro I.</p>\n<p>Il privilegio di Pio IV era un evidente segno di rispetto per il Comune, e fu confermato dai pontefici successivi. Anche se, secondo Giovanni Battista De Luca, i romani continuarono a preferire l’A.C. per le obbligazioni camerali, per via della sua alta specializzazione<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Pio V aprì invece alla giurisdizione del tribunale del Vicario sulle obbligazioni camerali. Lo fece, inizialmente, con il motu proprio <em>Considerantes</em> del 1566<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a>, in relazione alle persone ecclesiastiche ed ai <em>loca pia</em>, e vi tornò al momento della riforma del tribunale dell’A.C. introdotta il 20 novembre 1570 con il motu proprio <em>Inter illa</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a>. Stabilì che – pur nel riconoscimento dell’esclusiva competenza dell’A.C. quanto alla <em>cognitio</em> ed alla <em>executio</em> delle obbligazioni camerali – i debitori, quando cittadini romani laici, avrebbero potuto essere convenuti dinanzi alla Curia capitolina, mentre se chierici, romani per origine o per beneficio, si sarebbe ad essi applicato il principio della prevenzione tra A.C. ed ufficio del Vicario: ovvero il giudice adito per primo avrebbe potuto proseguire la causa.</p>\n<p>Paolo V confermò questa regola con la costituzione <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612)<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a>. Nonostante la norma rappresentasse, secondo il comune giudizio, la definitiva sistemazione della materia, dopo sessant’anni la giurisdizione del Vicario sulle obbligazioni camerali iniziò a divenire oggetto di altalenanti riforme: fino al 1742, quando con la costituzione <em>Quantum ad procurandam</em>, Benedetto XIV riportò la giurisdizione del Vicario entro i confini fissati dalla riforma di Paolo V<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-32\"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Per quanto riguarda le obbligazioni camerali contratte da romani, dunque, entravano in gioco il tribunale del Vicario nel caso di chierici, il tribunale del Senatore (la curia capitolina) per i <em>cives</em> laici.</p>\n<p>Ai provvedimenti pontifici sulla giurisdizione in materia di obbligazioni camerali, bisogna aggiungere l’indirizzo giurisprudenziale della Rota romana che, nel corso del Seicento, limitò ulteriormente la privativa dell’A.C. all’interno della Curia, sostanzialmente escludendo che l’A.C. potesse riassumere cause di obbligazione camerale introdotte dinanzi ad altri tribunali <em>extra Romanam Curiam</em>.</p>\n<p>La privativa, in fin dei conti, venne rispettata assai poco: la violavano il tribunale del Camerlengo e la Camera Apostolica, “prorettori e giudici delle basiliche, ospedali, chiese, congregationi e luoghi pii”, i consoli delle arti e dei mercanti senza averne alcun titolo e, nel caso di obbligazioni camerali stipulate da detenuti, se ne occupava il Presidente delle Carceri anche dopo la loro scarcerazione.</p>\n<p>Persino il Reggente di Cancelleria si riteneva giudice ordinario nelle cause d’obbligo camerale. Inoltre, la giurisdizione dell’A.C., insidiata dagli altri giudici romani, era contesa anche dalla Congregazione del Buon Governo<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a>,che finiva per occuparsi delle obbligazioni camerali nelle cause riguardanti debiti contratti dalle comunità. Insomma, dentro e fuori la città di Roma l’obbligazione camerale sembrava essere in mano a qualsiasi giudice<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Per quanto attiene alla documentazione relativa all’Accademia di San Luca, tra i moltissimi atti raccolti nel sito <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a> numerosi sono gli <em>instrumenta</em> dotati di formula di obbligazione camerale rogati da notai capitolini. Come abbiamo visto, i cittadini romani potevano richiedere l’esecuzione delle obbligazioni camerali tanto all’A.C. quanto alla Curia capitolina. Non si può però escludere che parte delle obbligazioni camerali dell’Accademia siano state gestite dal Vicariato, posto che essa, in quanto congregazione e conformemente alle disposizioni tridentine, al suo nascere era stata affidata da Gregorio XIII alla giurisdizione del Vicario<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a>. Sappiamo anche che nel 1606 il cardinale vicario Girolamo Pamphili aveva nominato il giurista Guazzino Guazzini come giudice delle cause tra i membri dell’Accademia<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a>, senza tuttavia fare alcun espresso riferimento alle obbligazioni camerali.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":1009,"subtitle":"La giurisdizione sull'obbligazione camerale dell'*Auditor Camerae*, della Curia capitolina, del tribunale del Vicario e degli altri","title":"Un'attività redditizia","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/obbligazione_camerale/II_Fiori_AttivitaRedditizia/"},{"content":"<p>Ma in cosa consisteva, in effetti, l’obbligazione <em>in forma Camerae</em>?</p>\n<p>L’obbligazione camerale nasceva dall’apposizione in un contratto di una predeterminata serie di clausole, le quali costituivano – nel complesso – una “formula”, capace di assicurare particolari tutele. Tra queste vi era innanzitutto la celerità dell’esecuzione, ma anche la speciale garanzia di poter accedere – cumulativamente o disgiuntamente – a una esecuzione reale (sui beni), a una esecuzione personale (detenzione in carcere), e persino a una spirituale (scomunica). Il complesso di queste tre forme di esecuzione faceva dell’obbligazione camerale un <em>unicum</em> nell’ambito della più vasta categoria degli strumenti esecutivi di età moderna, nella quale rientrava perché dotata della c.d. <em>executio parata</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>L’esecuzione parata rendeva i contratti, nei quali era apposta la formula, dei titoli esecutivi stragiudiziali (<em>enforceable titles</em>) particolarmente sicuri per il creditore. Nel caso di mancato adempimento non era necessario l’accertamento del credito attraverso un giudizio di cognizione (un processo civile ordinario), ovvero non occorreva verificare la situazione di fatto esistente tra le parti, che non era considerata controversa. Le possibilità di opporsi all’esecuzione presentando eccezioni o appelli erano poi drasticamente ridotte dall’espressa rinuncia ad avvalersene da parte del debitore.</p>\n<p>Nello Stato pontificio l’obbligazione camerale era il vero perno del processo di esecuzione, dava vita alla “prima e più frequente e più privilegiata” procedura, per usare le parole del grande giurista Giovanni Battista De Luca<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>In linea di massima, ovvero con qualche approssimazione tenuto conto delle modifiche intervenute nel corso del tempo, attraverso la formula camerale il debitore:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>obbligava se stesso e i suoi eredi, ed impegnava ed assoggettava ad ipoteca tutti i beni, mobili e immobili, presenti e futuri, suoi e degli eredi;</li>\n<li>si sottometteva a qualsiasi giurisdizione, e principalmente a quella, specifica, dell’<em>Auditor Camerae</em>;</li>\n<li>acconsentiva preventivamente alla scomunica e all’esecuzione personale, fino alla piena soddisfazione del credito;</li>\n<li>rinunciava ad opporsi in qualsiasi modo all’esecuzione;</li>\n<li>giurava di osservare e non revocare quanto indicato nello strumento.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Gli altri strumenti esecutivi utilizzati nell’età medievale e moderna (come la guarentigia, lo strumento sigillato o confessionato, l’obbligazione <em>penes acta</em>, ecc.), che pure sotto diversi aspetti erano molto simili all’obbligazione camerale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a>, potevano rivolgere i loro effetti “solo” al patrimonio e alla libertà personale del debitore.</p>\n<p>Trasformare i debitori inadempienti in peccatori scomunicati era un’arma aggiuntiva molto potente: significava non solo colpirli nella loro intima dimensione di fede, ma equivaleva a sabotarne la vita di relazione. La scomunica maggiore, infatti, separava il debitore dalla comunione della Chiesa e dei fedeli, che erano tenuti ad evitarlo. Su un soggetto che esercitava, ad es., l’attività mercantile, le conseguenze sul piano sociale e degli scambi commerciali potevano essere gravissime. Secondo lo <em>stylus</em> della Curia non potevano essere scomunicati vescovi, arcivescovi, patriarchi e cardinali, senza espresso mandato del papa.</p>\n<p>La scomunica per debiti era prassi piuttosto diffusa in molti paesi europei, almeno fino al XVI secolo<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a>. Al di fuori dello Stato Pontificio poteva essere irrogata nel solo ambito della giurisdizione ecclesiastica, ma colpiva i laici con estrema frequenza.</p>\n<p>Essa si basava giuridicamente su due presupposti.</p>\n<p>Innanzitutto, sull’uso diffusissimo di confermare contratti e negozi attraverso clausole giurate, ovvero clausole contenenti la promessa dell’esecuzione e l’impegno giurato a non revocare il contratto stesso. In quanto <em>res spiritualis</em>, il giuramento sottraeva la materia contrattuale alla competenza dei giudici civili a vantaggio di quelli ecclesiastici, a prescindere dall’oggetto del contratto<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-42\"><sup>42</sup></a>. Il fenomeno fu contrastato dai nascenti stati nazionali nella prima età moderna ma, alla metà del Quattrocento, il celebre giurista del Delfinato Gui Pape poteva affermare che “in omnibus instrumentis obligatoriis adhibetur iuramentum”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Quindi, una volta soggetti alla giurisdizione ecclesiastica, i debitori potevano incorrere in scomuniche come effetto della loro contumacia, intesa come <em>contemptus</em>: ovvero “oltraggio, disprezzo, rifiuto d’obbedienza, ostinazione, presunzione”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a>. Il mancato ottemperamento di una intimazione ad adempiere era appunto considerato un atto di disubbidienza “contumaciale”, e secondo le regole del diritto canonico la contumacia era la causa prima di ogni scomunica<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>L’indissolubile relazione tra obbligazione camerale e scomunica era inoltre legata ad uno stravolgimento dell’<em>iter</em> ordinario dell’esecuzione, che consentiva di colpire subito il debitore con una scomunica, per poi procedere contro di lui in un secondo momento anche in via reale e/o personale, congiuntamente o disgiuntamente secondo la richiesta del creditore. In altre parole, l’aggressione dei beni del debitore era residuale. L’ordinaria procedura esecutiva, invece, prevedeva che si cominciasse dall’espropriazione forzata dei beni mobili, poi degli immobili, poi dei beni dei fideiussori; infine si sarebbe passati all’esecuzione personale.</p>\n<p>Il Concilio di Trento cambiò radicalmente la configurazione dell’obbligazione camerale, modificando questa sua principale caratteristica. Se prima ad essere considerata residuale era l’esecuzione sui beni temporali, i decreti tridentini, nella xxv sessione di riforma, avevano fissato un criterio di moderazione nell’irrogazione della scomunica, precisando per le cause civili che essa potesse intervenire solo in caso di difficile esperibilità dell’esecuzione reale o personale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-46\"><sup>46</sup></a>. Dunque, era ora l’irrogazione della scomunica ad essere divenuta residuale rispetto all’esecuzione personale e reale.</p>\n<p>Nel 1570 la costituzione <em>Inter illa</em> di Pio V<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a> recepì il decreto del Concilio di Trento, e a partire da questa disposizione l’obbligazione camerale entrò in una seconda fase della sua storia, la fase “moderna”.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":831,"title":"L'*executio parata* delle obbligazioni camerali e la scomunica","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/obbligazione_camerale/III_ExecutioParata/"},{"content":"<p>La grande diffusione della formula camerale nei contratti, e la rapidità della procedura, creava una enorme mole di lavoro che, di fatto, gravava quasi interamente sugli uffici notarili<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-48\"><sup>48</sup></a>. Essi svolgevano spesso un ruolo di supplenza nei confronti dei giudici, i quali si limitavano in alcuni casi ad apporre firme in bianco su carte che poi i notai trasformavano in provvedimenti giurisdizionali. Specialmente in questi giudizi, diceva Sallustio Tiberi, “notarii debent esse oculi Iudicis”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-49\"><sup>49</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Era dinanzi ad un notaio che iniziava la procedura <em>in forma Camerae</em>. Nel rogare un contratto di mutuo, o di locazione, o di censo, o comunque relativo ad una obbligazione pecuniaria, il notaio apponeva le clausole tipiche, che consentivano l’<em>executio parata</em>. Il suo lavoro accompagnava poi ogni passaggio della procedura esecutiva.</p>\n<p>A differenza di quanto avveniva con gli strumenti guarentigiati, che contenevano in sé l’atto di precetto, nel caso delle obbligazioni camerali al notaio non era formalmente delegata alcuna giurisdizione<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-50\"><sup>50</sup></a>. I mandati esecutivi erano di competenza del giudice e la legislazione pontificia non prevedeva deroghe a questo principio. La routine intensa e ripetitiva dell’esecuzione delle obbligazioni <em>in forma Camerae</em> però, non consentiva che ogni provvedimento giurisdizionale necessario a perfezionare le varie fasi della procedura potesse essere effettivamente realizzato dal giudice secondo le formalità richieste.</p>\n<p>La maggior parte degli atti erano perciò, di fatto, compiuti dai notai del Tribunale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-51\"><sup>51</sup></a>. Solo in casi particolari, nei quali l’intervento dell’autorità giudiziaria era assolutamente indispensabile – come nell’emanazione di decreti definitivi – il requisito della forma scritta <em>ad nullitatem</em> era soddisfatto dalla firma del giudice in calce all’annotazione del notaio, fatta nel suo brogliardo, il <em>Liber actorum notariorum</em>.</p>\n<p>Con l’andare del tempo, lo <em>stylus</em> del Tribunale relativo all’esecuzione delle obbligazioni camerali si andò ampiamente modificando, e i cambiamenti più significativi finirono per attribuire una sempre maggiore autonomia ai notai attuari (ossia del Tribunale)<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-52\"><sup>52</sup></a>. Di pari passo con tale autonomia, crebbe anche la fiducia che l’Uditore doveva—di necessità—riporre in loro.</p>\n<p>Espressione di questa grande fiducia era il fatto che l’A.C. e i suoi Luogotenenti civili firmassero abitualmente in bianco carte, che solo successivamente venivano trasformate dai notai in provvedimenti giurisdizionali. In concreto erano perciò gli uffici notarili a rilasciare – a seconda delle esigenze – monitori o mandati esecutivi, o addirittura censure ecclesiastiche, senza bisogno di ricorrere nuovamente al giudice.</p>\n<p>Laddove possibile, il notaio guidava la procedura integrandola negli elementi mancanti, e le integrazioni divennero nel tempo costanti e conformi ad uno stile.</p>\n<p>Ad esempio, inizialmente la comminazione delle censure avveniva attraverso l’apposizione di una formula, vergata di propria mano da uno dei giudici del Tribunale in calce all’obbligazione o all’annotazione del notaio nel suo broliardo. Con l’andar del tempo era però invalso l’uso che i giudici, in un qualsiasi giorno d’udienza, si limitassero a firmare il testo scritto dal notaio nel suo broliardo<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-53\"><sup>53</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Allo stesso modo, la confessione del debito da parte del procuratore — che avrebbe dovuto svolgersi dinanzi ad un giudice dell’A.C. — e la presenza del procuratore al momento della stipula del contratto erano indicate fittiziamente dal notaio come avvenute, ma venivano di fatto eluse per non creare disordine negli uffici già affollati<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-54\"><sup>54</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Erano insomma le esigenze pratiche a determinare in concreto il procedimento, e i notai a indirizzarlo in base ad esse.

Nelle cause civili esse dovranno essere irrogate solo in <em>iuris subsidium</em>, ovvero in via residuale, quando non sia possibile procedere ad una esecuzione reale o personale<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-55\"><sup>55</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>La procedura di esecuzione dell’obbligazione camerale in uso fino al 1570 circa viene chiamata <em>stylus antiquus</em>. Il passaggio allo <em>stylus modernus</em> avvenne formalmente con la costituzione <em>Inter illa</em>, ma in realtà la transizione non fu brusca perché le innovazioni erano state precedute dal dibattito tra i giuristi su alcune questioni, ed alcune erano già state attuate nella prassi<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-56\"><sup>56</sup></a>. La nuova forma di obbligazione camerale venne poi perfezionata dalla costituzione <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612), nella quale Paolo V raccomandava che nell’esecuzione delle obbligazioni camerali fosse osservato lo <em>stylus hodiernus</em>. Esso si distingueva dalla <em>forma antiqua</em>, ormai superata, per alcune innovazioni, che venivano indicate dal papa: (1) la possibilità di un’unica citazione; (2) l’obbligazione nei confronti degli eredi (3) la mancata costituzione dei procuratori (4) la mancanza della <em>susceptio censurarum</em><a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-57\"><sup>57</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>È opportuno sottolineare che i due stili, dopo il 1570, non sono mai coesistiti, ma il più recente ha soppiantato l’antico.

Secondo De Luca, la formula moderna dell’obbligazione camerale, essendo caratterizzata da una “maiorem clausularum amplitudinem”, aveva risolto i dubbi interpretativi che la più antica aveva lasciato aperti, ed evitava il sorgerne di nuovi<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-58\"><sup>58</sup></a>. Soprattutto, essa semplificava la procedura perché aboliva le formalità superflue, che servivano solo ad assecondare strategie dilatorie ed erano pertanto di intralcio ai commerci.</p>\n<p>Le moltissime obbligazioni camerali che troviamo nella documentazione notarile relativa all’Accademia di San Luca, e conservata all’Archivio di Stato di Roma, riguardano un periodo successivo al 1570: esse seguono dunque lo <em>stylus modernus</em>. Sono riconoscibili in tal senso perché gli atti, per la maggior parte, fanno riferimento ad obbligazioni <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em>, espressione che indica l’applicazione dello stile moderno, ed è richiamata la responsabilità degli eredi. Per maggiore chiarezza cercheremo allora di descrivere la procedura esecutiva connessa all’obbligazione <em>in forma Camerae</em> evidenziando le caratteristiche proprie dello <em>stylus modernus</em>, non senza fare qualche accenno a quale fosse la procedura prima della riforma.</p>\n<p><strong>a. Lo strumento: <em>repetitio, recognitio</em> ed <em>extensio formulae</em> prima e dopo la riforma</strong></p>\n<p>L’obbligazione <em>in forma Camerae</em> poteva essere contenuta sia in uno strumento pubblico che in una scrittura privata. La forma pubblica non era necessaria per la validità del contratto ma consentiva una più celere esecuzione.</p>\n<p>Naturalmente, il massimo grado di certezza, e dunque di affidabilità, era dato dallo strumento pubblico rogato da un notaio attuario<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-59\"><sup>59</sup></a>, ed era anche consuetudine degli uffici notarili dell’<em>Auditor Camerae</em> apporre le clausole di obbligazione camerale nella generalità dei contratti che comportavano un’obbligazione pecuniaria, al punto che — anche quando non espressamente indicata — nello Stato pontificio la formula camerale si presumeva apposta. Con poche eccezioni: come nel comune di Bologna, dove non c’era l’uso di obbligarsi <em>in forma Camerae</em>.</p>\n<p>Inoltre, se il contratto era stato rogato da un notaio attuario, la clausola, oltre che apposta, si presumeva correttamente stilata. Dunque, non era necessaria alcuna ricognizione dell’atto, e si poteva immediatamente citare il debitore.</p>\n<p>Secondo lo <em>stylus antiquus</em>, però, se lo strumento fosse stato rogato da un notaio diverso, doveva poi essere prodotto davanti ad un attuario, che poteva limitarsi ad operarne una <em>repetitio</em> prima di procedere alla citazione oppure, se il primo notaio avesse in qualche modo abbreviato le clausole, come spesso accadeva, o la scrittura fosse stata privata, l’attuario avrebbe dovuto procedere alla cd. <em>extensio</em> della formula, per rendere lo strumento del tutto conforme alla forma di obbligazione camerale in uso. A tal fine il notaio era tenuto a compierne una <em>recognitio</em>, anche attraverso giuramento di testimoni.</p>\n<p>L’<em>extensio</em> consisteva nell’inserimento di tutte le clausole generali considerate essenziali nel contratto <em>in forma Camerae</em> (ad eccezione del giuramento), e dalla giurisprudenza rotale era considerata necessaria a pena di nullità<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-60\"><sup>60</sup></a>. Ad essa seguiva il <em>decretum de extendendo</em> dell’A.C.</p>\n<p>L’estensione era molto discussa, fonte di dispute sulle modalità di realizzarla, e occasione di espedienti dilatori per il debitore. De Luca la considerava un esempio di quelle “inutili formalità di cui l’antichità era tanto amica”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-61\"><sup>61</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Infatti, lo <em>stylus modernus</em>, che prevedeva una procedura più spedita, l’aveva in parte accantonata: chi si fosse obbligato <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em> (cioè secondo lo <em>stylus</em> moderno) attraverso uno strumento pubblico — anche non rogato dai notai dell’A.C. — non doveva più essere citato per l’<em>extensio</em> della formula. Era sufficiente che avesse acconsentito al mandato esecutivo <em>unica vel sine citatione</em>, e in questo caso veniva citato una sola volta, direttamente <em>ad solvendum</em>. La possibilità di evitare l’estensione non riguardava i contratti stipulati con scrittura privata, ed era esclusa nel caso di modificazione dei soggetti dell’obbligazione (<em>personae mutatae</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>b. Le citazioni</strong></p>\n<p>Verificato lo strumento, si citava il debitore.</p>\n<p>Normalmente, la citazione di un debitore domiciliato in Urbe avveniva <em>personaliter</em> oppure per <em>affixionem cedulae</em> sulla porta di casa: nel primo caso la citazione poteva essere per il giorno stesso (<em>hodie per totam</em>, cioè entro l’ora dell’udienza), nel secondo per il giorno dopo (<em>ad primam</em>).</p>\n<p>Se però il debitore non aveva il domicilio in Urbe e risultava <em>absens</em>, allora il creditore, dopo una sommaria ricerca, in città giurava sull’assenza del debitore, e il giuramento costituiva di per sé prova dell’assenza. Era tuttavia necessario, per poter procedere <em>in absentia</em>, che il credito fosse liquido, dunque determinato nel suo ammontare, altrimenti prima del giuramento avrebbe dovuto esser reso tale attraverso testimoni.</p>\n<p>In questo caso la citazione poteva avvenire <em>per audientiam contradictarum</em>, se fosse stato periodo di udienze, oppure <em>per affixionem</em> sulla porta della curia dell’Uditore o in altri luoghi soliti, se fosse stato periodo di <em>vacatio. L’audientia contradictarum</em> era una modalità di citazione utilizzata nei riguardi di “omnes contumaces ab Urbe absentes”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-62\"><sup>62</sup></a>. Le citazioni venivano lette dal <em>notarius contradictarum</em> in un luogo pubblico nei <em>dies iuridici</em>; nel <em>tempus vacationum</em> le <em>contradictae</em> venivano invece affisse.</p>\n<p>Nell’ambito dello <em>stylus antiquus</em> le citazioni del debitore erano molteplici. Nel caso in cui l’obbligazione fosse stata inserita in un atto che richiedeva estensione della formula, si veniva citati <em>ad dicendum contra iura</em>. Passati alla fase esecutiva vera e propria, la citazione del debitore avveniva una prima volta nei modi che abbiamo appena descritto, una seconda volta per la scomunica e il rilascio delle <em>litterae declaratoriae</em>, una terza volta per l’aggravazione, reaggravazione e invocazione del braccio secolare, una quarta per l’avvio dell’esecuzione forzata.</p>\n<p>La procedura era portata avanti a ritmo estremamente serrato, tanto che — se il debitore era domiciliato in Urbe e <em>praesens</em>, e senza la concessione di dilazioni — in una quindicina di giorni al massimo si poteva arrivare alla fase di espropriazione forzata. Le attività che si svolgevano nel corso di questo breve periodo erano numerose, persino incalzanti per l’obbligato. Si può dire che, nel complesso, la presenza del debitore fosse richiesta per alcune precise finalità: adempiere, confessare o veder confessato il debito, essere scomunicato.</p>\n<p>Chi invece si fosse obbligato secondo lo <em>stylus modernus</em> acconsentendo al mandato esecutivo <em>unica vel sine citatione</em>, veniva citato una sola volta, direttamente <em>ad solvendum</em>. Una volta comparso in giudizio l’obbligato riceveva l’intimazione ad adempiere e, in assenza di eccezioni rilevanti, veniva contestualmente rilasciato il mandato esecutivo. Se invece avesse dato il consenso <em>ad una bina citatio</em>, allora il mandato sarebbe stato rilasciato nella seconda ed ultima udienza.</p>\n<p><strong>c. Confessione del debito e scomunica</strong></p>\n<p>Lo <em>stylus antiquus</em> si caratterizzava per la confessione del debito e la scomunica. Trascorso il termine previsto dalla prima citazione, la confessione del debito veniva compiuta, su istanza del creditore, da uno dei procuratori indicati nello strumento, per la somma contenuta nello strumento stesso.</p>\n<p>Avuta la confessione del debito, su istanza del creditore il giudice dichiarava che l’obbligato sarebbe incorso nella sentenza di scomunica se non avesse adempiuto entro tre giorni (<em>nisi infra tres dies</em>), fatta salva la possibilità di opporre – in quei tre giorni, e non oltre – rilevanti eccezioni, tra le poche concesse all’obbligato <em>in forma Camerae</em>.</p>\n<p>Decorsi i <em>tres dies</em> senza l’adempimento – benché il termine potesse essere differito fino a trenta giorni – il giudice, alla presenza del creditore o del suo procuratore, dichiarava scomunicato il debitore se entro la giornata non avesse adempiuto. Trascorsa inutilmente la giornata, venivano emanate le cd. <em>litterae declaratoriae</em>. Le declaratorie non servivano per la comminazione della scomunica (già pronunciata con la formula <em>nisi infra tres dies satisfecerit</em>), ma per la sua pubblicazione e per le conseguenze sociali che essa comportava: come si sa, infatti, lo scomunicato andava evitato dai fedeli.</p>\n<p>È il caso di sottolineare che i <em>tres dies</em> indicati dal giudice non erano che un simulacro della <em>trina monitio</em> richiesta dal diritto canonico. In questo modo le due fondamenta giuridiche della scomunica — la contumacia e le <em>monitiones</em> — venivano formalmente preservate.</p>\n<p>Le lettere declaratorie venivano materialmente redatte da un notaio attuario, consegnate all’attore ed affisse da un cursore del tribunale a Campo de’ Fiori, in modo tale che si sapesse pubblicamente che il debitore era scomunicato. Passati dieci giorni senza che l’adempimento fosse stato effettuato, il debitore veniva citato un’altra volta, per <em>aggravatio, reaggravatio</em> e <em>auxilium brachii saecularis</em>. In sostanza, all’udienza il giudice aggravava le censure invocando l’ausilio del braccio secolare, e rilasciava le “lettere aggravatorie”, che contenevano sia l’ordine di conseguire dal patrimonio del debitore beni per il valore del debito, al fine di venderli all’asta, sia di incarcerare il debitore finché non avesse soddisfatto il debito integralmente.</p>\n<p>In forza di queste lettere, si affiggevano in giro per la città cartelloni scritti in lettere maiuscole, alla sommità dei quali – in vilipendio dei debitori – erano disegnate con vari colori immagini “deformes atque indecorae.”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-63\"><sup>63</sup></a></p>\n<p>Lo <em>stylus hodiernus</em> non richiedeva più la costituzione dei procuratori <em>ad confitendum debitum</em>. Era una trasformazione significativa della procedura, perché alla <em>confessio in iure</em> del debito era stata riconosciuta sino a quel momento un’importanza decisiva ai fini dell’efficacia dell’obbligazione camerale, della quale costituiva un elemento antichissimo. La costituzione <em>Inter illa</em> aveva invece stabilito che il procuratore potesse essere costituito per la confessione del debito solo se fosse stato nominato dal convenuto anche per la propria difesa, e non avesse accettato l’onere della difesa. La disposizione era stata confermata dalla bolla <em>Universi agri dominici</em> nel 1612. Nello stesso anno, Sigismondo Scaccia attestava che la costituzione del procuratore era ormai scomparsa dalla pratica giudiziaria e, di fatto, a sparire fu anche la confessione giudiziale del debito. Lo stesso Scaccia sosteneva che se, dopo la riforma, se ne fosse ancora trovata traccia negli strumenti dotati di obbligazione camerale, essa sarebbe stata verosimilmente fittizia<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-64\"><sup>64</sup></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Esecuzione reale e personale</strong></p>\n<p>Dopo la scomunica (secondo lo <em>stylus antiquus</em>), oppure prima o in sua assenza (secondo lo <em>stylus modernus</em>), era possibile procedere contro il debitore in via reale e/o personale, congiuntamente o disgiuntamente secondo la richiesta del creditore. Il debitore aveva facoltà di evitare o far cessare in qualsiasi momento la procedura esecutiva consegnando la somma dovuta, in contanti, agli esecutori.</p>\n<p>L’esecuzione personale portava al carcere e, teoricamente, poteva colpire qualsiasi obbligato. Di fatto affliggeva le categorie sociali più indifese, perché i giudici, per prassi, risparmiavano l’arresto a prelati, baroni, uomini illustri e “donne oneste”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-65\"><sup>65</sup></a>. La detenzione cessava solo <em>soluto debito</em>, o dopo il deposito di idonea cauzione.</p>\n<p>L’esecuzione reale sui beni mobili avveniva attraverso l’apprensione degli stessi dalla casa del debitore (o da altro luogo) ed il loro deposito: quest’ultimo, dopo l’istituzione da parte di Urbano VIII nel 1625, avveniva presso la Depositaria urbana dei pubblici pegni.</p>\n<p>Nel caso di immobili, si procedeva al pignoramento attraverso l’<em>accessio ad domum</em>, ed eventualmente <em>ad vineam</em>, dell’obbligato, alla presenza di testimoni, dell’esecutore e del notaio attuario della causa, che ne redigeva verbale.</p>\n<p>Compiuto il pignoramento, mobiliare o immobiliare, su istanza del creditore l’esecutando veniva citato per ricevere l’intimazione a consegnare il denaro, a soddisfacimento parziale o totale del credito, con decreto <em>nisi ad primam diem</em>, cioè entro un giorno. Decorso inutilmente il breve termine, veniva emesso nei confronti degli esecutori il mandato di consegna dei pegni ai cursori, per la vendita dei beni all’incanto.</p>\n<p>Ricevuti i beni, i cursori li descrivevano in una cedola, e poi provvedevano all’asta.</p>\n<p>Una volta che i beni erano stati venduti al miglior offerente, se il ricavato non era sufficiente a soddisfare il creditore, era consuetudine della Curia che si procedesse ad ulteriore esecuzione — sia reale che personale — in forza del primo mandato, fino alla soddisfazione integrale del credito.</p>\n<p><strong>e. Le eccezioni e la vulnerazione</strong></p>\n<p>La formula dell’obbligazione camerale prevedeva la rinuncia alla presentazione di eccezioni ed appelli.</p>\n<p>Tuttavia, era generalmente ammesso che contro l’esecuzione delle obbligazioni camerali si potesse opporre una terna di eccezioni: <em>falsitas, solutio</em> e <em>quietatio</em>. Non erano però tassative, ed altre erano ammesse sia in base alla loro rilevanza sia, soprattutto, a condizione che non ostacolassero o ritardassero l’esecuzione.</p>\n<p>Non potevano infatti essere evitate quelle eccezioni che si fondavano sulla <em>incompetentia iudicis</em>, sulla <em>inhabilitas</em> dell’attore (perché ad esempio minore, bandito o scomunicato) o sul suo inadempimento (<em>res non tradita, pretium non solutum</em>), e sulla nullità dello strumento.</p>\n<p>In linea generale, secondo dottrina e giurisprudenza, alcune eccezioni potevano essere semplicemente rigettate, altre impedivano la prosecuzione del processo perché la loro ammissibilità era immediatamente evidente dalla lettura dello strumento, o da fatto notorio, o dalla natura della cosa (ad es. <em>res non tradita</em>, <em>res non libere tradita</em>, ecc.). Quelle eccezioni che non erano immediatamente accertabili ma richiedevano un’ulteriore indagine, ad esempio per testimoni, potevano essere rigettate per non ritardare l’esecuzione.</p>\n<p>Questo criterio generale lasciava comunque spazio ad una casistica di eccezioni ammissibili.</p>\n<p>L’esecuzione doveva però essere sempre interrotta in caso di <em>vulneratio</em>, ovvero quando fosse intervenuta una sentenza, o un lodo arbitrale, di assoluzione del debitore. L’obbligazione vulnerata perdeva l’<em>executio parata</em>, e diventava sempre appellabile. L’appello però, costituiva l’unico rimedio per il creditore, che doveva poi aspettare le tre sentenze conformi.</p>\n<p>Tanto i trattatisti quanto la giurisprudenza guardavano con una certa ostilità all’ipotesi che un qualche evento – persino un fatto così importante come l’assoluzione del debitore – potesse ostacolare o interrompere la procedura esecutiva. De Luca non faceva mistero del considerare la sentenza assolutoria un “grave pregiudizio” per il creditore, ed avvertiva i giudici “a non essere lubrici e facili alle sentenze assolutorie”.<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-66\"><sup>66</sup></a></p>\n<p><strong>f. L’obbligazione nei confronti degli eredi</strong></p>\n<p>Ai tempi dello <em>stylus antiquus</em> era dibattuto se l’obbligazione camerale si trasferisse agli eredi<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-67\"><sup>67</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Era incontestato che l’obbligazione si trasferisse integralmente agli eredi del creditore. Rispetto agli eredi del debitore, però c’erano molti dubbi. Innanzitutto, perché l’obbligazione camerale consisteva in un impegno giurato, e gli eredi sarebbero incorsi in uno spergiuro per un giuramento che non avevano personalmente prestato, o persino in una scomunica. Ma la questione che sembrava centrale ed ostativa della successione nell’obbligazione era quella del mandato ai procuratori.</p>\n<p>La formula camerale, secondo lo <em>stylus antiquus</em>, includeva infatti la costituzione di procuratori, con mandato a confessare il debito in nome e per conto del debitore per la somma indicata nel contratto, e si riteneva che tale mandato dovesse considerarsi revocato con la morte del debitore. Tuttavia, alla metà del Cinquecento la piena Segnatura di Giustizia era giunta alla conclusione, poi recepita dalla prassi, di considerare esecutabili i beni del debitore defunto, poiché il mandato, essendo inserito nel contratto camerale <em>ad alterius commodum</em>, non poteva essere revocato tacitamente alla morte del debitore<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-68\"><sup>68</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Negli anni seguenti, dopo la riforma dell’obbligazione camerale del 1570, la soluzione indicata dalla Segnatura di Giustizia fu rafforzata dal venir meno della costituzione dei procuratori. Dunque la trasmissibilità agli eredi, sulla quale la dottrina era stata esitante fino al 1555, si avviò a diventare una caratteristica tipica dello <em>stylus modernus</em>. Come tale venne indicata nella costituzione <em>Universi agri dominici</em> (1612).</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"afiori"}],"length":2599,"subtitle":"stylus antiquus e modernus","title":"La procedura prima e dopo il 1570","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/obbligazione_camerale/V_Procedura/"},{"content":"<p>La grande fortuna dell’obbligazione camerale si basava sul fatto che essa consentiva un’esecuzione molto celere, liberando il creditore non solo dall’attesa della conclusione di un processo ordinario, ossia di accertamento del debito, ma anche da qualsiasi ritardo derivante dalla resistenza che il debitore avrebbe potuto opporre nell’attuazione di una ordinaria procedura di esecuzione.</p>\n<p>Era un’esecuzione assolutamente privilegiata, la cui rapidità ed efficienza erano però del tutto a svantaggio di una sola parte, il debitore. Egli giurava di adempiere, esponendosi allo spergiuro e impegnando non solo tutti i propri beni, presenti e futuri, ma anche i beni presenti e futuri dei propri eredi, la propria libertà personale, e correva persino il rischio della scomunica. Si assoggettava alla giurisdizione di qualsiasi giudice ed accettava che il mandato esecutivo contro di lui fosse rilasciato subito, a seguito di una sola citazione. Rinunciava ad ostacolare l’esecuzione non solo con eccezioni o appelli, ma con qualsiasi beneficio previsto a suo favore dalla legge, e — salvo il caso rarissimo di essere stato assolto per sentenza — poteva evitare l’esecuzione solo con l’adempimento.</p>\n<p>Nell’assumere un impegno così gravoso, egli non era sempre ben informato delle responsabilità che ne derivavano, perché per consuetudine i notai nei loro strumenti abbreviavano la formula dell’obbligazione camerale, fino a renderla incomprensibile e irriconoscibile per chi già non la conoscesse. Se Antonio Massa, nel Cinquecento, riteneva che l’obbligo camerale fosse noto a tutti, compresi donne e contadini<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-69\"><sup>69</sup></a>, nella realtà – e con l’andare del tempo – il fatto di dare per presupposte informazioni relative alla gravità degli impegni assunti diventò un elemento ulteriormente e pesantemente vessatorio per il debitore. A partire dal Settecento – quando il clima culturale e giuridico nei confronti dell’obbligazione camerale era ormai fortemente cambiato – questo aspetto venne spesso denunciato e lamentato dai giuristi: i notai informavano le parti, e specialmente colui che assumeva gli obblighi <em>in forma Camerae</em> “con la massima circospezione”<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-70\"><sup>70</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Considerato che l’uso notarile di abbreviare fortemente la formula – anche tra i numerosi documenti dell’Accademia di San Luca digitalizzati e trascritti per questo progetto – rende obiettivamente difficile riconoscere le obbligazioni camerali e il loro contenuto, mi sembra utile fornire qualche suggerimento per individuarle.</p>\n<p>Quelle che seguono sono brevi indicazioni per riconoscere la formula dell’obbligazione camerale negli strumenti notarili dell’Accademia e per facilitarne la ricerca nel database del sito <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>l’incipit della formula è sempre <em>Pro quibus</em>;</li>\n<li>si trova l’espressione <em>in forma Camerae Apostolicae</em>, ma spesso, trattandosi di obbligazioni che riflettono lo <em>stylus modernus</em> (post 1570), la dizione usata è <em>in ampliori forma Camerae</em>: questo dovrebbe comportare, se le parti non hanno convenuto diversamente, che l’obbligazione si trasferirà agli eredi anche <em>ex parte debitoris</em>;</li>\n<li>per questa ragione si fa riferimento <em>ad haeredes e bona</em>;</li>\n<li>la formula è sempre abbreviata <em>cum clausulis solitis etc.</em>;</li>\n<li>sono indicate rinunce (ad appelli ed eccezioni);</li>\n<li>è indicato il consenso all’<em>unica</em> citazione;</li>\n<li>si chiude con il riferimento ad un giuramento.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In altri termini, pur con qualche difformità tra un notaio e l’altro, la formula abbreviata si presenta indicativamente così:</p>\n<p>Pro quibus <em>etc.</em> se <em>etc.</em> heredes <em>etc.</em> bona omnia <em>etc.</em> in ampliori forma Camerae Apostolicae <em>cum clausulis solitis etc.</em> citra <em>etc.</em> renuncians <em>etc.</em> obligavit ac mandat<em>um etc.</em> unica <em>etc.</em> et tactis iuravit Super quibus etc.</p>\n<p>Nel contenuto, questa abbreviazione corrisponde alla seguente formula dello <em>stylus modernus</em> dell’obbligazione camerale, per la quale si fa normalmente riferimento al testo riportato da Silvestro Zacchia nelle <em>Lucubrationes ad Gallesium de obligatione Camerali, quibus praeter additiones eiusdem Authoris […] accesserunt aliae Lanfranchi Zacchiae I.U.D.</em> (Roma 1647)<a href=\"/endnotesita/#note-71\"><sup>71</sup></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pro quibus omnibus, et singulis praemissis tenendis, complendis et inviolabiliter observandis idem A. debitor se ipsum, suosque haeredes, ac successores quoscumque, ac bona sua, et suorum quaecunque tam praesentia, et futura tam mobilia quam immobilia, ubilibet existentia iura, actiones, et debitorum nomina in ampliori forma Camerae dicto B. praesenti, et acceptanti, et pro se, suisque haeredibus, et successoribus quibuscunque stipulanti, et recipienti obligavit et hypotecavit, nec non Curiae causarum Camerae Apostolicae eiusque Camerarii, Vicecamerarii, Auditoris, Viceauditoris, Regentis, Locumtenentis, et Commissarii, ac omnium et singularum aliarum Curiarum Ecclesiasticarum, et secularium ubilibet constitutarum iurisdictionibus, coercionibus, compulsionibus, iuribus, rigoribus, stilis, et meris examinibus supposuit, et submisit, per quas curias, et earum quamlibet tam coniunctim, quam divisim, voluit, et expresse consensit se, ac suos haeredes, et successores praedictos posse realiter, ac personaliter cogi, compelli, astringi, excommunicari, aggravari, reaggravari, et ad brachium seculare deponi, arrestari, capi, incarcerari, et detineri uno et eodem tempore, vel diversis temporibus, et per diversorum temporum intervalla usque ad plenariam, et integram praemissorum observationem, ac omnium et singulorum damnorum, expensarum, et interesse praemissorum occasione forsan faciendorum, et substinendorum integram refectionem, et restitutionem, ita tamen quod executio unius Curiae executionem alterius non impediat, nec retardet, non obstante iuris dispositione, quod ubi iudicium incęptum est, ibidem terminari debeat, et quod causarum continentiae non dividantur, et quod quis teneatur in ea actione, quam intentavit usque ad finem litis persisteret, et qualibet alia iuris, et facti exceptione in contrarium facente, non obstante, et quavis alia iuris, seu facti exceptione, quae posset alligari in contrarium facente, non obstante; ita quod una via electa non censeantur ullo modo alteri renunciatum.

Il più celebre tra questi strumenti, perché di origine medievale ma anche per la sua diffusione, è la “guarentigia”. Ogni ordinamento della penisola italiana aveva però il suo patto esecutivo tipico: se la guarentigia, come ricordavano i doctores medievali, nasce in Toscana, il Piemonte aveva lo “strumento sigillato”, le Marche quello “ad voluntatem”, altre regioni quello “confessionato”, il Regno di Napoli l’obbligazione “penes acta”, e lo Stato pontificio, appunto, l’obbligazione camerale. A differenza di altri strumenti esecutivi propri di particolari regioni o Stati, gli strumenti giurati, confessionati e guarentigiati godevano di un più generalizzato riconoscimento della loro <em>executio parata</em> secondo il Diritto comune romano-canonico.

Tuttavia, sulla base della confessione e con il consenso delle parti, nello strumento guarentigiato il notaio rivolgeva direttamente al debitore l’intimazione ad adempiere, attraverso un <em>praeceptum</em> incorporato nell’atto. Formalmente, questo era reso possibile da una parificazione della <em>confessio</em> al giudicato, ma comportava anche un’attribuzione di giurisdizione al notaio che non tutti gli ordinamenti concedevano. Nello Stato pontificio ai notai non era riconosciuta alcuna formale delega di giurisdizione. Cfr.

1630 was a city of people, men for the most part, on the move. In 1600 the population burst past the 100,000 mark for the first time since late antiquity, but immigrants and visitors flowed in and out so frequently that a static census scarcely gestures at its dynamism.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> Although we can start to measure growth only at this moment, all evidence points to a cresting wave that began around the middle of the century and broke sometime during the Borghese and Barberini pontificates (1605–1644). Among the migrants, men predominated because of the special nature of economic opportunity in papal Rome; what jobs there were, chiefly in service, construction, and bureaucracy, drew a largely male labor force. As is well known, many of these mobile men arrived in Rome seeking work in the art trades, and in the hundreds and perhaps thousands they found it.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> The public wealth of the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy combined with the private fortunes of cardinals, bankers, and aristocrats to lure talent, skill, and brawn from as far as Flanders and as near as the Sabine hills. When the Umbrian painter and theorist Federico Zuccaro for a second time joined the throngs on the road to Rome in the early 1590s, he brought along a recent Florentine experiment, the idea of an association of selected men devoted to or skilled in <em>disegno</em>, an <em>accademia</em> where artistic education would flourish. On those same roads he probably barely noticed among his fellow travelers men with the distinctive pen and inkwell of the notarial profession, men often from the hill towns of central Italy who were hoping to find jobs in Rome.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a> We do not know whether Zuccaro paid closer attention to these quill bearers when he discussed his great plan with artists in Rome who had been pursuing a similar project since the 1570s, but we do know that the notaries were paying attention to him. They were present at the meeting of March 7, 1593, that established an academy, and at meetings before and after.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Indeed, scholars are discovering that much of what we can know about the early decades of the experiment to establish an <em>accademia</em> for artists in Rome we owe to the attention of notaries.</p>\n<p>Notaries are a helpful point of entry into the history of any institution, and especially Roman institutions in this period of rapid change, because they remind us that the fixed, stable units about which we would like to write are fictions. Real institutions seldom proceed with the clarity and predictability that historians describe, and the records that we use to draw these portraits are rarely the transparent documents that they appear to be. But the organizational effervescence, indeed turbulence, of late 16th- and early 17th-century Rome was such that it would be particularly misguided to believe in the firm contours and crisp boundaries of its institutions. Because Roman notaries documented the gatherings of groups of many shapes, sizes, and aspirations, they leave a singularly authentic picture of the fragility, chaos, and mutability of associations in these decades.</p>\n<p>Why were forms of urban collective life in such flux at the turn of the 17th century? Immigration and population increase are certainly part of the answer, but religious and political factors also played a significant role. The renewal of Catholicism both before and after the Council of Trent (1545–1563) stimulated the founding of new sodalities for charitable and devotional activities, many of which focused their energies on the city of Rome.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a> It also invigorated existing confraternities, such as the one dedicated to Saint Luke, to which the painters and allied art workers belonged, leading frequently to new projects or ambitions and the changes in governance and procedure necessary to pursue them. This bending and stretching of corporate bodies in the 16th century has left its mark in the many examples of revised or new rules (<em>capitoli, ordini, institutioni</em>) that scholars find in Roman libraries and archives.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a> Generically but inaccurately called <em>statuti</em>—a term that, strictly speaking, should be reserved for the rarer versions confirmed by appropriate municipal or papal authorities—these documents in all their variety testify to the strong feelings invested in the few early modern institutions in which participants had a voice. For trade guilds the decades from around 1550 to 1650 stand out in particular as a period of new foundations, secessions, and aggregations with a feverish revision of regulations in both manuscript and print.</p>\n<p>While the splintering and combining of craft organizations may owe something to the spiritual motions of confraternities, which were often their matrix, it may also reflect a canny political strategy. The pontiffs themselves intervened radically to transform many established Roman institutions in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, from the cardinalitial congregations to the municipal tribunal and its notaries. Centralization of control in the hands of the state (that is, the papal government) may have been their aim, but their means often had the opposite effect. When the popes created privileged associations in order to exploit their collaboration with policies of state, they inadvertently advertised the benefits of forming new groups. Rome’s artisans and tradesmen were not slow to catch on. Institutional fluidity was favored by another paradox. Despite the concentration of authority over church and state in the hands of the pontiffs, political power in Rome was dispersed more widely among the elite than in a normal dynastic capital. The 70 members of the college of cardinals, one of the unique features of this ecclesiastical kingdom, functioned as centers of influence and patronage that royal courtiers might well have envied.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a> Competing organizations thrived where patrons multiplied.</p>\n<p>Although this picture emphasizes the vitality of these efforts to create new forms of collective life in Rome, the agents and actors themselves must often have felt frustration and disappointment, for it was a struggle in which many aspirants failed. The corporate spectrum might range from occasional gatherings of a few like-minded men to traditional privileged bodies with their own tribunals on the Capitoline hill, but few were satisfied with their place along the spectrum. Even in this dynamic city there were not enough resources—money, influence, prestige, patronage—to go around. Moreover, arbitrary power could deal painful setbacks. How must the members of the painters’ confraternity have felt when, after decades of saving to rebuild their church on the Esquiline, Pope Sixtus V expropriated the property in 1588 and sent them to the dilapidated Santa Martina near the Forum?<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a> We know from the notarial protocols that some groups, such as the sculptors in 1608, tried to become independent organizations and were prevented from doing so.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a> The same sources also show us many evanescent professional associations, which never managed to move far enough up the institutional hierarchy to acquire property and a meeting place, let alone formal recognition in official statutes.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a> Institution building in Rome between 1590 and 1630 was a process with well-defined strategies and goals, but with uncertain and uneven results. It was fraught with conflict, not a neat process, and it did not advance at a regular and predictable pace. Once set in motion, it could just as easily halt, momentarily or forever.</p>\n<p>The story that the notaries reveal about the early years of the Accademia di San Luca conforms in most of its key features with this general pattern. They gave multiple, overlapping names to their client (<em>universitas, collegio, congregatio, societas, accademia</em>), probably because it was so unclear what the identity of the group actually was. Attempts to write and rewrite the rules of the organization have left us with four or perhaps five sets of so-called statuti in less than 40 years. Years go by when there is hardly any sign of life in the association, to be followed by months of frenzied meetings.</p>\n<p>Yet the notaries also reveal that the Accademia di San Luca stands out from the pack for its remarkable rise in institutional status. In its first four decades, it achieved an unparalleled social ascent, leaving behind the lowly condition of the manual worker and forging an image of gentlemanly expertise. Even more significant was the fact that it broke away from the political structures that pinned down artisanal organizations and achieved the freedom of those engaged in noble and liberal pursuits. Before 1570 the painters, like the stone carvers and all other artisans, were subject to the jurisdiction of the municipality, the Senate and Roman People, with the Conservatori as their judges.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a> In 1577 Pope Gregory XIII, recognizing their sensitive theological role as makers of sacred images, shifted them to the jurisdiction of the cardinal vicar.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1624 they sought to shake off the vicar’s court and achieve the privilege of relative autonomy under their own cardinal protector.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a> Such freedom demanded assiduous clientage to the powerful, especially after 1627 when the pope’s nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, became their protector; it was, nonetheless, the height of prestige in the Roman context. In the history of Roman institutions, therefore, the early years of the Accademia di San Luca mark an important chapter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Header image: Pieter Brueghel the Younger,</em> Village Lawyer <em>(detail), 1621, Museum voor Schone Kunsten Gent</em></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1531,"title":"Notaries and the Accademia di San Luca, 1590–1630","type":"splash","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaries/"},{"content":"<p>Around 1970 two art historians on parallel tracks opened a new window onto the early years of the Accademia di San Luca with their discovery that among the thousands of volumes (called protocols) of notarized contracts kept in the Roman state archive were records of meetings of artists’ sodalities, including the academy.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a> Systematic efforts to mine these sources were not attempted until the past two decades, and it is only with the development of <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma</em> that they have been collected and made accessible.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a> In her 1972 study of Simon Vouet’s leadership of the academy, Noelle de La Blanchardière wondered what meeting records were doing in the notarial protocols and speculated on what the notaries’ relationship to the Accademia might have been.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a> Historians have also turned their attention to the services performed by notaries for artisan organizations, finding that notarial traces may well be the only evidence left by substantial portions of the laboring classes of early modern Rome.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> We are now in a better position to answer de La Blanchardière’s questions and to shed light on the nature of these indispensable records of the early Accademia.</p>\n<p>The practice of gathering to deliberate on common concerns was customary in early medieval Europe. In Italy in the Middle Ages use of a notary to record the names of those present at a meeting and a synthetic account of the decisions made took hold in ecclesiastical institutions and in the nascent communes.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a> In his professional capacity as bearer of <em>pubblica fides</em>, the notary represented the public face of authority and endowed the documents that he sealed or signed with a specific, quantifiable probative value. Although medieval jurists might quibble about just what quantity of proof the notary added, it was generally agreed that his writings were worth the equivalent of two or three witnesses, which was about as high a standard as unaided human beings could achieve.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a> Neither jurists nor notarial handbooks say anything about meeting records,<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a> although the handbooks do supply models for many kinds of <em>instrumenta</em> (as contracts were called) that clients like the Accademia di San Luca might want, such as receipts, obligations, or acts taking possession of property. Although they give no direction, therefore, on the form that meeting records should take, the manuals do acknowledge the practice by providing examples of powers of attorney in which corporate bodies establish proxies.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a> It was essential in such texts to name those for whom the agent was authorized to act, and the legal principle that consent was personal and specific undoubtedly underpinned this custom. Notaries wrote down the decisions that the men who attended and voted bound themselves to carry out. Since these resolutions often had financial repercussions, it was imperative to formalize the obligation, and, since it was often desirable to bind a group to enforce a common policy, it made sense to have a notary present as a matter of course.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a> By the same token, of course, such gatherings as lectures and classes that had no organizational implications or financial agenda were unlikely to be described in the notary’s protocols.</p>\n<p>Whatever its origins, the practice of using notaries to document meetings must have spread widely in late medieval Italian cities. In Rome the picture is obscured by the absence of surviving notarial sources before the mid-1300s and by heavy subsequent losses, but the wool guild statutes preserve such a record from 1421.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a> We can assume that the painters who formulated statutes for their confraternity in 1478 were familiar with the practice, and we would expect their 16th-century descendants to have paid notaries not only for instruments but also for their work as corporate scribes.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a> The difficulty for researchers is not that we do not understand why the notaries attended meetings of collectivities, but that in Rome at least it is so hard to find these records before the 1580s.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":666,"title":"The Notarial Tradition","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaries/I_Nota_Notarial/"},{"content":"<p>Ironically, it was the very Sixtus V who forced the painters’ association to move from the Esquiline in 1588 who was also responsible for the systematic survival of their notarial activity and thus of our new insight into the origins of the Accademia. In 1586 Sixtus intervened radically in the workings of the notarial profession in Rome, which, unlike that of most Italian cities, was double. Civic, or Capitoline, notaries catered to the needs of citizens and prepared court documents for the municipal tribunal located in the Palazzo del Senatore. Curial notaries, many of them foreign, worked instead in the papal bureaus and papal courts that focused on the needs of ecclesiastics. In practice this division was blurry to clients, with laymen using curial notaries and clerics patronizing those of the Capitoline, but the two groups of notaries were indeed distinct because lay and clerical tribunals followed different legal procedures.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a> What Sixtus did was to restrict the previously unlimited number of Capitoline notaries to 30 and for the first time sell their offices, thus initiating the process of turning a free and very loosely organized profession into a closed corporation of venal officeholders.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> Fifteen of the newly created notarial offices provided judicial services to each of two civil judges (<em>collaterali</em>) in the Senator’s tribunal. Over the preceding century, the popes had made all curial notaries venal, so now ownership of notarial offices became the norm in Rome. However, within 25 years, the popes made a unique concession to the Capitoline notaries. In 1612 Paul V granted them the right to bequeath or sell their offices as if they were any other form of property.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a> While the actual titleholders of the office had to be notaries, had to expedite their titles through civic officials, and had to be admitted to the new college of notaries of the Capitoline court (<em>notarii curiae capitolii</em>), anyone could purchase the office either in whole or in part and dispose of it freely.</p>\n<p>In the 50 years between 1583 and 1634 the various painters’ associations, including guild, confraternity, and academy, as well as the confraternity of stoneworkers in which the sculptors found themselves trapped, employed Capitoline notaries to redact their formal obligations and record payments, receipts, property transfers, inventories, and, importantly, their litigation. Seven notaries worked for the Accademia in these years: Ottaviano, Marco Aurelio, and Alessandro Saravezzi and Giovanni Antonio Moschenio, Erasto Spannocchia, Lorenzo Tigrino, and Tommaso Salvatore. We know their names and can find out who their clients were as a result of Sixtus V’s imposition of venality on the Capitoline notaries and of Paul V’s insistence on new archival practices for notarial documents. The period from 1586 to 1612 wrought revolutionary changes in the way in which Roman notaries did their work, and it is no coincidence that the Accademia di San Luca emerges from obscurity in this same arc of time.</p>\n<p>His <em>signum</em>, the unique logo that Roman notaries used to stamp the first page of their protocols and the public copies of their instruments, identified the Roman-born Ottaviano Saravezzi as a Capitoline notary even before Sixtus V’s intervention of 1586.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> He had worked for the carpenters and masons in the early 1580s and even joined the carpenters’ confraternity in 1584, the year in which he also made out a receipt for a purchase of wood by the painters’ guild (<em>universitas</em>).<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a> For the next 10 years, and then again from 1600 to 1607, Saravezzi continued to produce instruments for the painters, both guild and confraternity, and of course recorded the meeting of March 7, 1593, in which they organized an academy. While dozens of notaries in the ambit of the Capitoline tribunal lost their professional status in 1586, the pope’s new policy permitted Saravezzi to purchase for 500 scudi the notarial office that he had been operating all along, in a sense turning his business into a form of property.<a href=\"/notaendnotesnotaendnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a> The property consisted not in the physical space in <em>rione</em> Pigna where his clients found him, but rather in the volumes of protocols containing their contracts and testaments and in the documents of their litigation. Scholars sometimes overlook the revenues that notaries earned from their conduct of lawsuits because they have left such meager traces compared to the business acts in the protocols, but Sixtus V had expected lawsuits to be the lure that would entice notaries to buy their offices. Ottaviano Saravezzi had now become one of 15 Capitoline notaries who produced and filed litigation papers with the second <em>collaterale</em>, one of the four judges in the tribunal of the Senator. Each month he and the other 29 professionals in the college of notaries of the Capitoline court pooled a percentage of their judicial earnings.<a href=\"/v/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a> Although his gleanings ranked him in the middle rather than at the top of the group, they prove that clients used him for court papers as well as contracts.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-32\"><sup>32</sup></a> As Antonia Fiori’s article “The Cameral Obligation in the Documents of the Accademia di San Luca” explains, court notaries were the beating heart of the judicial system. All legal actions started with an appearance before one of them, and they operated with considerable independence since the magistrates trusted them to fill out the summons and warrants (<em>mandati</em>) to which the judges had already put their signatures.</p>\n<p>Venality had an immediate, as well as a long-term, impact on Saravezzi. In 1584 the instruments he produced for his clients in a single year filled one bound volume; seven years later they occupied three volumes. The contraction in the number of city notaries resulted in more business for Saravezzi. In addition, since the acts he rogated for his clients were now a substantial investment, he had a powerful incentive to preserve them carefully. Inventories of the protocols in the possession of the 30 Capitoline notaries document a sea change in the 1580s, with virtually complete series for most offices for the next three centuries. We can get a good idea of the state of conservation of clients’ acts prior to venality from looking at the stray pre-1580s volumes that survive in some of the 30 offices; these often consist of a hodgepodge of disordered instruments rogated by several different notaries.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a> Even more dispiriting is the collection of protocols in the Roman state archive labeled Notai Capitolini (Capitoline Notaries). In actuality this represented an attempt beginning in the 1560s to halt the loss of volumes that occurred when a notary died and his family inherited the little cache of notebooks from which he had made a livelihood. This series, which contains most of what we have in the way of surviving protocols in Rome before 1586, consists largely of those that the authorities managed to capture from the heirs after a notary’s death. The excessive freedom of the Roman notarial profession before Sixtus V explains why it has been so hard to track the activities of artists’ associations in earlier decades.</p>\n<p>A second effect of venality, which showed up gradually from the 1590s on, was to increase the size of the notary’s workforce. The documents we find in the protocols are rarely in the hand of Ottaviano Saravezzi.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a> A titleholder might employ one or two, and by the 1620s perhaps as many as four or five, young men to do much of the actual writing of the office, some authorized as notaries and others mere scribes.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a> With the <em>padrone</em> at the head, the notarial office had a hierarchy.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a> <em>Sostituti</em> were employees who were official notaries; they had full authority to certify contracts (business acts or instruments) and undertake judicial work, such as taking witness testimony or writing out legal summons. <em>Giovani</em> were the men, usually young, who transcribed the rough notes of transactions into full texts to be kept in the protocols; they had not yet served enough time to qualify for <em>sostituto</em> status or for some reason had not sought it. <em>Giovani</em> also prepared the tables of contents to be inserted into the protocols before they went out for binding, following office practice or their own inclination in determining what name to give to clients. Saravezzi himself attended the important meeting of March 7, 1593, but by the 1620s it was much more common to find <em>sostituti</em> documenting academy gatherings. Although there was usually rapid turnover in the staff, some employees remained in a given office for years, even while the titleholder changed. Joseph Palmuctius, for example, who worked in office 15 from 1621 to 1627, spanned the tenure of three Capitoline notaries, Spannocchia, Tigrino, and Salvatore. His name appears frequently as the recorder of meetings of the Accademia in that busy period.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a></p>\n<p>The increasing number of employees represented growth in the notaries’ business under the impact of venality, but also reflected intensified government regulation of notarial acts. From the middle of the 15th century, Capitoline notaries were required to bind their instruments yearly and put their names on the covers, but rules for notarial writing grew much stricter between 1580 and 1612. New municipal and papal laws demanded that full transcriptions be made within one month (1580),<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a> that notarial volumes be bound every three months (1612), that an alphabetical table of contents listing the client’s name and the folio number of the instrument be placed at the beginning of each volume (1612), and that <em>sostituti</em> sign their names at the bottom of the acts they had rogated (1612).<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a> Most of these measures aimed to protect the integrity of the records against tampering, but they had the corollary effect of making it easier to keep track of them.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1598,"title":"The New Capitoline Notaries and Their Records","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaries/II_Nota_Capitoline/"},{"content":"<p>More rigorous control of writing practices meant more labor and hence more scribes, but it also generalized the use of the table of contents in Roman notarial protocols, which makes it easier to find the acts and meetings of artists’ associations like the Accademia di San Luca. Nevertheless, state rigor did not extend to linguistic usage, and, as we have seen, it often fell to subordinate employees to decide what name to give a corporate client in the notarial records. Confraternity *(<em>societas</em>) and guild (<em>universitas</em>) were familiar, conventional terms, but what to call unprecedented modes of association or new formations? Ottaviano Saravezzi’s index for the first volume of 1593 lists the meeting of March 7, 1593, as a <em>congregatio</em> (“congregatio pictorum”), which, in the word’s general sense of a gathering, it surely was.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a> The notary and his staff preferred not to make fine discriminations. They erred on the side of more titles rather than fewer, so we frequently see them coupling the painters’ “collegio et universitas” (1589), “collegio et societas” (1600), or “collegio et accademia” (1626).<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a> This inclusiveness may also have a deeper significance. That the leaders of the initiative resulting in the March 1593 meeting used the services of Saravezzi, the same notary who had been working for some years for the painters’ guild and confraternity, implies that they wanted to reform from within rather than break away in a new organization. Dissident or disgruntled members of groups turned to different notaries when they set out on a new course.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-42\"><sup>42</sup></a> The founders of Rome’s academy in 1593 did not see themselves as creating a separate institution for artists.</p>\n<p>For more than 20 years, the painters’ guild, confraternity, and academy used Saravezzi’s office 11 for meetings, business acts, and litigation.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a> When Ottaviano mysteriously disappears from the college of Capitoline notaries from 1594 to 1600, the artists employed Marco Aurelio Saravezzi, and when Ottaviano returned in 1600 they remained with him and his next successor, Alessandro Saravezzi, until 1609. Notaries liked to have institutional clients and especially to have formal appointments to serve as an association’s secretary. In the age of venality, such positions increased the value of the office. Notaries appointed as corporate secretaries were often paid a yearly retainer and were thus guaranteed steady income. Moreover, ancillary business could arise when members went for their personal needs to the same notary they had come to know at confraternity meetings or in the guild tribunal. The guild of carpenters even required this, treating it as a form of compensation for its notary.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a> Some institutions, for example the hospital of the Santissimo Salvatore in Rome, offered such a captive market for document making that it sold the right to be its secretary to the highest bidder.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a> Although the numerous revised <em>statuti</em> of the Accademia di San Luca do not refer to its notary as a secretary, Erasto Spannocchia does identify himself as such.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-46\"><sup>46</sup></a> In 1623 Spannocchia negotiated an annual provision of 3 scudi from the artists’ “confraternity or Academy.”<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a> The enduring relationship between the various painters’ associations and specific Capitoline notarial offices is clear, and was indeed the norm in Rome. It made sense for an institution to stay with one office, particularly when the common practice was to reference instruments by the notary’s protocol and date rather than to pay for a personal copy.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-48\"><sup>48</sup></a></p>\n<p>Notwithstanding their long attachment to office 11 in Via del Gesù, in 1609 the artists switched to office 15, not far away, just east of Piazza Sant’Eustachio, where they kept their business for the next 25 years. The presumed death of Ottaviano Saravezzi sometime after 1607 could not be the only explanation for the shift because the painters had stayed with his office during the late 1590s, when Marco Aurelio Saravezzi was titleholder. Moreover, later on they registered no reaction to the death of their secretary Spannocchia in the midst of a very active period of meetings and decisions in fall 1624, remaining loyal to office 15 as it went through another change of <em>padrone</em> three years later. How to explain the sudden departure to a new notary in 1609?</p>\n<p>It appears to be a fresh twist on the practice whereby rebels took themselves to a different notary when they had grievances against their leaders. The details are murky, as is so often the case in the academy’s early history, but they point to Gaspare Celio’s term as <em>principe</em> (prince, director) of the Accademia in 1609 as the flash point. Celio was the focus of an intense conflict within the artists’ association, as a well-known but undated plea to the pope from the painters’ guild makes clear.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-49\"><sup>49</sup></a> The petition asks the pontiff to order the judge with jurisdiction over the painters, Guazzini de Guazzinis of the cardinal vicar’s court, to punish Gaspare Celio. The painters charge that Celio broke into the archive of the confraternity of San Luca and removed its documents. They insinuate that he was an illegitimate <em>principe</em>, and they also accuse him of making new rules (<em>capitoli</em>) “against freedom and the public good” and posting them publicly without the consent of the collectivity. Although we lack further details about Celio’s alleged poster campaign, the <em>principe</em> did take proud responsibility for printing the somewhat authoritarian 1607 <em>statuti</em> of the Accademia early in 1609. On the final page of the first edition of the Accademia <em>statuti</em>, he wrote in his own hand: “I, Gasparo Celio, now <em>principe</em> of the Illustrious Accademia of the Painters of Rome, had the present volume printed at the request of the entire Illustrious Accademia, and I confirm this in my own hand today, January 27, 1609.”<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-50\"><sup>50</sup></a> Subsequent events raise questions about whether the “entire” academy really had made such a request.</p>\n<p>Just a few months later, four members of the “generale congregatione” of San Luca appeared in Alessandro Saravezzi’s office 11, on May 12, 1609, to appoint an attorney, Severo Particelli, to undertake litigation on their behalf.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-51\"><sup>51</sup></a> On June 3 their <em>camerlengo</em> made a payment “on behalf of the Academy and <em>congregatio</em>” to one Joseph Cidonius to represent them before judge Guazzini de Guazzinis.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-52\"><sup>52</sup></a> This document of June 3, 1609, is the last trace of the painters in notarial office 11. The next dated transaction by the academy, a routine <em>stima</em> obligation of July 23, 1609, is found in Giovanni Antonio Moschenio’s office 15, as are subsequent instruments, lawsuits, and meetings.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-53\"><sup>53</sup></a> Since the Roman-born Moschenio was Celio’s personal notary, it seems likely that Celio found the painters so completely united against him that the only way to hold onto power was to remove the business of the Accademia to a notary loyal to himself.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-54\"><sup>54</sup></a> Moschenio proved appealing to other members, however, winning their trust so fully that for six years he even served as their treasurer (<em>camerlengo</em>), a very rare occurrence in notarial relations with institutional clients.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-55\"><sup>55</sup></a> Moschenio was not the only one involved who survived Celio’s eclipse after 1612. Agabito Visconti, documented in the painters’ confraternity from 1595 and the man who delivered the petition against Celio to the pope, was still deeply engaged at the meeting held on January 8, 1619, when he was one of two representatives from the <em>compagnia</em> chosen to rewrite the statutes of 1617.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-56\"><sup>56</sup></a></p>\n<p>By then Capitoline notary Erasto Spannocchia of San Polo in Sabina had taken over office 15. We first see his name in a document concerning the rental of the buildings next to the painters’ church in January 1618; he died in the summer or early fall of 1624. Under Spannocchia, or perhaps later, the meeting records for the period 1618 to 1621 were not bound in the protocols but gathered in a separate volume, now in the archive of the Accademia di San Luca, which was an occasional practice among other Roman corporations.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-57\"><sup>57</sup></a> Spannocchia’s office must have been well run, for the strenuous conflicts over the form and leadership of the academy that marked 1624, the year Antiveduto Gramatica was forcibly replaced as <em>principe</em> by Simon Vouet, were recorded without interruption by a staff who had lost their <em>padrone</em>.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-58\"><sup>58</sup></a> Spannocchia’s successor was briefly Lorenzo Tigrino, who is first documented at work for the painters in June 1625.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-59\"><sup>59</sup></a> In 1627 Tommaso Salvatore of Spoleto, who over the next 20 years made office 15 one of the busiest in Rome, was signing documents as a <em>sostituto</em> for Tigrino.<a href=\"/notaendnotes/#note-60\"><sup>60</sup></a></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1402,"title":"The Accademia di San Luca and Its Notaries","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaries/III_Nota_Accademia/"},{"content":"<p>The notaries who worked for the variously named associations of painters in the years 1590 to 1630 filed the instruments and meetings they produced, with few exceptions, in their protocols. As we have seen, these years were marked by a transformation in the way in which notarial protocols, objects of new scrutiny by state and investors, were treated and valued. In these decades, tensions and conflicts among the community of artists and art workers in Rome erupted frequently, and they often targeted the documents that seemed most important to their organizations, whether <em>universitas, collegio, congregatio, societas</em>, or <em>accademia</em>. Quite apart from the many, largely peaceful revisions of the rules for running the Accademia, assaults on the San Luca archives were not unheard of. Even the obsessive inventorying of the contents of the cupboards in the academy’s rooms betrays some anxiety about its control. In the context of such passions, the most important contributions of the Accademia’s notaries were probably to remain in the background: to be present, to witness, to record, to transcribe, to copy, to file, and to bind. In a city marked by men on the move, the notaries too were necessarily fluid. They showed up and disappeared with efficient agility. Avoiding the spotlight, the notaries paid attention, and then slipped away. On their shelves, the protocols that marked their success as venal officeholders silently accumulated. Fortunately, no one had noticed, and the testimony to the early years of the Accademia would keep safely for the next five centuries.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":251,"title":"Conclusions","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaries/Nota_Conclusion/"},{"content":"<p>This text is a revised and updated version of an essay of the same name, originally published in 2009 in <em>The Accademia Seminars: The Accademia di San Luca in Roma, c. 1590–1635</em>, edited by Peter M.

Per la prima volta dalla tarda antichità, nel 1600 il numero degli abitanti superò la soglia delle 100.000 unità, ma il continuo andirivieni di immigrati e visitatori era tale che un censimento, per natura statico, difficilmente riesce a tradurre  una realtà così dinamica<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-1\"><sup>1</sup></a>. Sebbene sia soltanto a partire da questi decenni che possiamo iniziare a registrare l’incremento della popolazione, i dati a noi disponibili indicano come la crescita demografica, già iniziata intorno alla metà del Cinquecento, rallentò solo durante il pontificato Barberini (1623-1644). Tra i migranti gli uomini erano in numero predominante per la particolare natura delle opportunità economiche offerte dalla Roma papale; le possibilità d’impiego riguardavano principalmente i settori dei servizi, dell’edilizia e della burocrazia, che richiamavano una forza lavoro in gran parte maschile. Come è noto, molti di questi individui arrivarono nella città eterna in cerca di un mestiere nei settori dell’arte, e furono centinaia, se non migliaia, a trovarlo<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Le ricchezze pubbliche della Chiesa e del papato, cui si associarono le fortune private di cardinali, banchieri e aristocratici, attrassero talenti, abilità e manovalanza da posti lontani come le Fiandre e vicini come le colline della Sabina. Nei primi anni novanta del Cinquecento alla moltitudine di coloro che prendevano la via per Roma si unì, per la seconda volta, il pittore e teorico marchigiano Federico Zuccari, il quale portava con sé l’idea, sperimentata di recente a Firenze, di creare un’associazione di uomini scelti dediti al disegno o esperti di questa disciplina, un’accademia in cui sarebbe fiorita la cultura artistica. Lungo la strada aveva forse a malapena notato che tra i suoi compagni di viaggio ve ne erano alcuni con la penna e il calamaio, strumenti tipici della professione notarile, persone spesso provenienti dalle arroccate cittadine dell’Italia centrale che speravano di trovare lavoro a Roma<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Non sappiamo se Zuccari abbia prestato loro maggiore attenzione quando a Roma discusse il suo grande progetto con artisti che fin dagli anni settanta del Cinquecento avevano perseguito un’idea simile, ma sappiamo che i notai gli prestarono attenzione, partecipando sia alla riunione del 7 marzo 1593 che portò alla fondazione di un’accademia, sia agli incontri precedenti e successivi<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. In effetti, gli studiosi si stanno rendendo conto che gran parte di quel che sappiamo sui primi decenni in cui si tentò l’esperimento di istituire a Roma un’accademia per artisti lo dobbiamo proprio all’attento lavoro dei notai.</p>\n<p>I notai rappresentano un utile punto di accesso alla storia di qualsiasi istituzione, in particolare di quelle romane in un periodo di rapidi cambiamenti come questo, perché ci aiutano a comprendere come la presunta stabilità e immutabilità di determinate strutture sia di fatto fittizia. Nella realtà, le istituzioni raramente agiscono con la chiarezza e la prevedibilità descritte dagli storici, e i documenti che utilizziamo per tracciarne il ritratto raramente sono così trasparenti come sembrano. L’effervescenza, se non la turbolenza organizzativa della Roma tra la fine del Cinquecento e l’inizio del secolo successivo era tale che sarebbe fuorviante credere che le sue istituzioni potessero avere una fisionomia stabile e dai netti confini. I notai romani, avendo documentato le riunioni di gruppi molto diversi per forma, dimensioni e aspirazioni, ci hanno lasciato un quadro singolarmente autentico della fragilità, del caos e della mutevolezza delle associazioni createsi in quei decenni.</p>\n<p>Perché all’inizio del Seicento le forme di vita collettiva cittadina erano in continua mutazione? In parte ciò era dovuto all’immigrazione e all’aumento della popolazione, ma un ruolo significativo lo ebbero anche fattori religiosi e politici. Il movimento di riforma del cattolicesimo, sia prima sia dopo il Concilio di Trento (1545-1563), incentivò la fondazione di nuovi sodalizi dediti ad attività caritatevoli e devozionali, molti dei quali concentrarono le proprie energie sulla città di Roma<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>. La riforma diede inoltre rinnovato vigore alle confraternite esistenti—come quella dedicata a San Luca, cui appartenevano i pittori e i lavoratori dell’arte—cosa che spesso si tradusse in nuovi progetti e ambizioni e nella modifica delle procedure amministrative necessarie per perseguirli. Questa continua mutazione degli organi corporativi nel Cinquecento ha lasciato il segno nei tanti esempi di revisione o creazione di nuove regole (<em>capitoli, ordini, institutioni</em>) che gli studiosi trovano nelle biblioteche e negli archivi romani<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>. Chiamati genericamente ma impropriamente <em>statuti</em>—termine che, in senso stretto, dovrebbe essere riservato alle più rare versioni avallate dalle competenti autorità municipali o pontificie—questi documenti testimoniano in tutta la loro varietà il forte coinvolgimento personale dei partecipanti in quelle che, di fatto, erano fra le poche istituzioni della prima età moderna, in cui potevano avere voce in capitolo. Per quanto riguarda le corporazioni dei mestieri, i decenni che vanno dal 1550 al 1650 si segnalano come un periodo di nuove fondazioni, di secessioni e aggregazioni, con una febbrile revisione degli ordinamenti, sia manoscritti sia a stampa.</p>\n<p>Lo scindersi e il fondersi delle organizzazioni artigiane deve probabilmente qualcosa ai movimenti spirituali delle confraternite, che spesso ne sono state la matrice, ma può anche essere il riflesso di un’astuta strategia politica. Gli stessi pontefici intervennero, tra la fine del Cinquecento e l’inizio del Seicento, per trasformare radicalmente molte istituzioni romane consolidate, dalle congregazioni cardinalizie al tribunale municipale con i suoi notai. L’accentramento del controllo nelle mani dello Stato (cioè del governo pontificio) era forse il loro obiettivo, ma i metodi utilizzati ebbero spesso l’effetto opposto. Quando i papi crearono associazioni privilegiate in modo da poterne sfruttare la collaborazione nelle politiche dello Stato, involontariamente pubblicizzarono i vantaggi della formazione di nuovi gruppi. Gli artigiani e i commercianti di Roma non tardarono a capirlo. La mutevolezza istituzionale fu favorita da un altro paradosso. Nonostante l’autorità ecclesiastica e statale fosse concentrata nelle mani dei pontefici, a Roma il potere politico era distribuito tra i membri dell’élite più diffusamente che in una normale capitale dinastica. I settanta membri del collegio cardinalizio—una delle peculiarità di questo regno ecclesiastico—assumevano una funzione di centri di influenza e di mecenatismo tale da fare invidia  ai membri di una corte reale<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>. Laddove si moltiplicavano i mecenati, le organizzazioni in concorrenza tra loro prosperavano.</p>\n<p>Per quanto questo quadro enfatizzi la vitalità degli sforzi volti a creare nuove forme di vita collettiva a Roma, gli stessi agenti e attori devono aver spesso provato frustrazione e delusione, poiché questa fu una lotta che vide fallire molti aspiranti. Lo spettro delle varie organizzazioni corporative spaziava dalle riunioni occasionali di pochi con intenti simili ai tradizionali enti privilegiati che avevano i propri tribunali sul colle Capitolino, ma poche erano soddisfatte del posto che occupavano. Anche in una città dinamica come questa le risorse— denaro, influenza, prestigio, mecenatismo— non erano sufficienti per tutti quanti. Inoltre, l’arbitrarietà del potere poteva frapporre battute d’arresto. Come devono essersi sentiti i membri della confraternita dei pittori quando, dopo decenni di risparmi per ricostruire la loro chiesa sull’Esquilino, nel 1588 papa Sisto V gliela tolse e li relegò nella fatiscente chiesa di Santa Martina vicino al Foro?<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a> Sappiamo dai protocolli notarili che alcuni gruppi provarono a rendersi indipendenti, come quello degli scultori nel 1608, ma fu loro impedito di farlo<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a>. Le stesse fonti mostrano come molte associazioni professionali fossero evanescenti e impossibilitate a salire abbastanza in alto nella gerarchia istituzionale da riuscire ad acquisire beni e un luogo di ritrovo, tanto meno un riconoscimento formale in statuti ufficiali<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>. Creare un’istituzione a Roma tra il 1590 e il 1630 comportava un processo scandito da obiettivi ben definiti, ma rischioso di risultati incerti e disomogenei. Un procedimento carico di conflitti, che non progrediva con ordine e con un ritmo regolare e prevedibile. Una volta messo in moto, poteva altrettanto facilmente arrestarsi, momentaneamente o per sempre.</p>\n<p>Come emerge dai documenti notarili, le vicende dei primi anni dell’Accademia di San Luca,  si conformano nei loro tratti salienti a questo schema generale. I notai davano al loro cliente molteplici nomi, che spesso si sovrapponevano (<em>universitas, collegio, congregatio, societas, accademia</em>), probabilmente perché non era affatto chiaro quale fosse l’effettiva identità del gruppo. I tentativi di scrivere e riscrivere le regole dell’organizzazione ci hanno lasciato quattro o forse cinque serie di cosiddetti <em>statuti</em> in meno di quarant’anni. Nei documenti, mesi di incontri frenetici si alternano ad anni di stallo istituzionale.</p>\n<p>Ciò nonostante,  i notai mostrano anche come l’Accademia di San Luca si distinguesse per la sua notevole ascesa nel rango istituzionale. Nei suoi primi quattro decenni di vita l’Accademia riuscì a compiere una scalata sociale senza pari, liberandosi dell’umile condizione del lavoro manuale e forgiando un’immagine di signorile competenza. Ancora più significativo il fatto che l’accademia riuscì a staccarsi dalle strutture politiche che immobilizzavano le organizzazioni artigiane e a raggiungere la libertà che avevano quelle impegnate in attività nobili e liberali. Prima del 1570 i pittori erano soggetti, come gli scalpellini e tutti gli altri artigiani, alla giurisdizione della municipalità, cioè del Senato e Popolo Romano, e avevano i Conservatori come loro giudici<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a>. Nel 1577 papa Gregorio XIII, riconoscendo il delicato ruolo teologico che rivestivano in qualità di artefici di immagini sacre, li trasferì sotto la giurisdizione del cardinale vicario<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a>. Nel 1624 cercarono di liberarsi dal tribunale del vicario e di ottenere il privilegio di una relativa autonomia sotto un proprio cardinale protettore<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a>. Una tale libertà esigeva un rapporto di assiduo clientelismo con i detentori del potere e questo fu particolarmente vero dopo il 1627, quando divenne protettore dell’accademia il cardinale Francesco Barberini, nipote del papa; niente di meno che l’apice del prestigio nel contesto romano. Nella storia delle istituzioni cittadine, dunque, i primi anni dell’Accademia di San Luca costituiscono un capitolo importante.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Immagine in alto: Pieter Brueghel il Giovane,</em> L’avvocato del villagio <em>(dettaglio), 1621, Museum voor Schone Kunsten Gent</em></p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1607,"title":"I notai e l’Accademia di San Luca, 1590-1630","type":"splash","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaieaccademia/"},{"content":"<p>Intorno al 1970 due storici dell’arte, muovendosi su binari paralleli, gettarono nuova luce sui primi anni dell’Accademia di San Luca scoprendo che, tra le migliaia di volumi di contratti autenticati (chiamati protocolli) conservati presso l’Archivio di Stato, vi erano i verbali degli incontri dei sodalizi di artisti, tra cui anche quelli dell’accademia<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a>. Fino a una ventina di anni fa non è stato intrapreso alcun lavoro sistematico di ricerca che portasse alla luce tutte queste fonti, che sono state raccolte e rese accessibili soltanto con lo sviluppo del sito “The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma”<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>. In un saggio del 1972 sul ruolo di Simon Vouet come guida dell’accademia, Noelle de La Blanchardière si chiedeva come mai i verbali delle riunioni fossero contenuti nei protocolli notarili e rifletteva su quale potesse essere il rapporto tra i notai e l’accademia<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a>. Gli storici hanno rivolto la loro attenzione anche ai servizi prestati dai notai per le organizzazioni artigiane, scoprendo che le tracce notarili potrebbero essere l’unica testimonianza lasciata da parti sostanziali delle classi lavoratrici nella Roma della prima età moderna<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a>. Siamo ora in una posizione migliore per rispondere alle domande di La Blanchardière e per far luce sulla natura di questi documenti indispensabili per ricostruire i primi anni dell’accademia.</p>\n<p>Nell’Europa dell’alto Medioevo era consuetudine riunirsi per deliberare su questioni che riguardavano la comunità. Nelle istituzioni ecclesiastiche e nei nascenti comuni dell’Italia medievale si affermò la pratica di chiedere a un notaio di registrare i nomi dei presenti ad un’adunanza e di compilare un resoconto sintetico delle decisioni prese<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a>. Nella sua qualità professionale di portatore di <em>pubblica fides</em>, il notaio rappresentava il volto pubblico dell’autorità e conferiva agli atti che sigillava o firmava un valore probatorio specifico e quantificabile. Per quanto i giuristi medievali potessero cavillare sulla quantità di prove addotte dal notaio, era generalmente accettato che i suoi scritti avessero il valore equivalente a quello di due o tre testimoni, che era più o meno lo standard più elevato che chiunque potesse ottenere senza altro aiuto<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a>. Né i giuristi né i manuali notarili dicono nulla sui verbali delle riunioni<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a>, anche se i manuali forniscono modelli per molti tipi di <em>instrumenta</em> (come venivano chiamati i contratti) di cui clienti come l’Accademia di San Luca avrebbero potuto necessitare, quali ricevute, obbligazioni o atti di presa di possesso di proprietà. Pur non fornendo alcuna indicazione, quindi, sulla forma che avrebbero dovuto assumere i verbali delle riunioni, i manuali ne recepivano la pratica fornendo esempi di procure con cui gli organi societari stabilivano le deleghe<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a>. In testi di questo genere era di fondamentale importanza che fossero nominati tutti coloro per i quali l’agente era autorizzato a operare, e alla base di questa consuetudine c’era indubbiamente il principio giuridico secondo cui il consenso è personale e specifico. I notai registravano le decisioni che i presenti si impegnavano a mettere in pratica. Poiché queste risoluzioni avevano spesso ripercussioni finanziarie, era essenziale formalizzarne gli obblighi e, dato che spesso era opportuno vincolare il gruppo per imporre una politica comune, si comprende perché fosse prassi comune avere un notaio presente alle riunioni<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a>. Per la stessa ragione, era ovviamente improbabile che incontri come conferenze e lezioni che non avevano alcuna implicazione organizzativa o fini finanziari fossero descritti nei protocolli del notaio.</p>\n<p>Qualunque sia la sua origine, la consuetudine di servirsi dei notai per documentare le riunioni deve essersi ampiamente diffusa tra le città italiane nel tardo Medioevo. Per quanto riguarda Roma, l’assenza di fonti notarili precedenti la metà del 1300 e le vaste perdite di quelle successive rende confuso il quadro, ma tale pratica è testimoniata dal 1421 negli statuti delle corporazioni della lana<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a>. Presumibilmente quindi, i pittori che nel 1478 formularono gli statuti per la loro confraternita conoscevano la pratica ed è plausibile che i loro discendenti cinquecenteschi pagassero i notai non solo per gli atti, ma anche per il loro lavoro in qualità di scrivani della corporazione<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a>. Per gli studiosi il problema nasce non tanto dal fatto che non si capiscano le motivazioni della partecipazione dei notai alle riunioni di una collettività, quanto dalla difficoltà, perlomeno a Roma, nel reperire questo genere di documenti prima degli anni ottanta del Cinquecento.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":710,"title":"La tradizione notarile","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaieaccademia/I_TradNotarile/"},{"content":"<p>Per ironia della sorte, è a Sisto V, il papa che nel 1588 aveva costretto l’associazione dei pittori ad abbandonare la sede dell’Esquilino, che dobbiamo la sopravvivenza sistematica della loro attività notarile e quindi la nuova visione delle origini dell’accademia. Nel 1586 il papa intervenne radicalmente sul funzionamento della professione notarile che a Roma, diversamente dalla maggior parte delle città italiane, era duplice. I notai civici, o capitolini, provvedevano alle esigenze dei cittadini e preparavano atti giudiziari per il tribunale municipale situato nel Palazzo del Senatore. I notai curiali, molti dei quali stranieri, lavoravano invece negli uffici e nei tribunali pontifici che si occupavano delle esigenze degli ecclesiastici. Nella pratica, questa divisione non era così netta per i clienti  e vi furono laici che si servirono di notai curiali e chierici che erano clienti abituali di quelli capitolini, ma i due gruppi di notai erano effettivamente distinti perché il tribunale laico e quello clericale seguivano procedure legali diverse<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a>. Sisto V limitò a trenta il numero precedentemente illimitato dei notai capitolini e per la prima volta mise in vendita i loro uffici, avviando così il processo di trasformazione della loro professione da attività libera e organizzata in modo molto vago a ufficio facente parte di una corporazione chiusa di funzionari venali<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a>. Quindici degli uffici notarili di nuova creazione fornivano servizi giudiziari a uno dei due giudici civili <em>(collaterali</em>) del tribunale del Senatore, quindici  all’altro. Nel secolo precedente i papi avevano reso venali tutti i notai curiali, così ora la possibilità di ottenere la proprietà degli uffici notarili divenne la norma. Tuttavia, in venticinque anni, i papi fecero un’unica concessione ai notai capitolini: a differenza dei notai curiali nel 1612 Paolo V assicurò loro il diritto di lasciare in eredità o vendere il proprio ufficio come una qualsiasi altra forma di proprietà<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a>. Mentre gli effettivi titolari dell’ufficio dovevano essere notai riconosciuti da funzionari civici e ammessi nel nuovo collegio del tribunale capitolino (<em>notarii curiae capitolii</em>), chiunque poteva acquistare l’ufficio, o per intero o in parte, e disporne liberamente.</p>\n<p>Tra il 1583 e il 1634, le varie associazioni di pittori, tra cui corporazione, confraternita e accademia, nonché la confraternita degli scalpellini, in cui si trovavano intrappolati gli scultori, si avvalsero dei notai capitolini per provvedere ai loro obblighi formali e registrare pagamenti, quietanze, trasferimenti di proprietà, inventari e, soprattutto, contenziosi. In questi anni lavorarono per l’accademia sette notai: Ottaviano, Marco Aurelio e Alessandro Saravezzi, Giovanni Antonio Moschenio, Erasto Spannocchia, Lorenzo Tigrino e Tommaso Salvatore. Siamo a conoscenza dei loro nomi e possiamo scoprire i loro clienti grazie all’imposizione della venalità ai notai capitolini voluta da Sisto V e all’insistenza di Paolo V sulle nuove pratiche archivistiche dei documenti notarili. Il periodo che va dal 1586 al 1612 apportò cambiamenti rivoluzionari nelle procedure dei notai romani e non è un caso che l’Accademia di San Luca emerga dall’oscurità proprio in questo arco di tempo.</p>\n<p>Il suo <em>signum</em>, il logo unico che i notai romani usavano per bollare la prima pagina dei loro protocolli e le copie pubbliche dei loro atti, identificava il romano Ottaviano Saravezzi come notaio capitolino ancor prima dell’intervento di Sisto V del 1586<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a>. Saravezzi aveva lavorato per falegnami e muratori nei primi anni ottanta del Cinquecento ed era addirittura entrato nella confraternita dei falegnami nel 1584, anno in cui emise anche una ricevuta per un acquisto di legname da parte della corporazione dei pittori (<em>universitas</em>)<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a>. Per i successivi dieci anni, e poi ancora dal 1600 al 1607, Saravezzi continuò a produrre atti sia per la corporazione sia per la confraternita dei pittori e, ovviamente, verbalizzò la riunione del 7 marzo 1593, in cui fu costituita la loro accademia. Mentre nel 1586 decine di notai attivi nell’ambito del tribunale capitolino persero il loro status professionale, la nuova politica del papa consentì a Saravezzi di acquistare per 500 scudi lo studio notarile in cui aveva sempre esercitato, trasformando in un certo qual modo la sua attività in una forma di proprietà<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a>. La proprietà non consisteva nello spazio fisico nel rione Pigna dove lo trovavano i suoi clienti, ma piuttosto nei volumi dei protocolli contenenti i loro contratti e testamenti e negli atti delle loro controversie. Gli studiosi a volte trascurano i profitti che i notai ricavavano dallo svolgimento delle cause perché hanno lasciato tracce molto scarse rispetto agli atti commerciali presenti nei protocolli, ma Sisto V si aspettava che proprio le cause sarebbero state il richiamo che li avrebbe indotti ad acquistare i loro uffici. Ottaviano Saravezzi era ora diventato uno dei quindici notai capitolini che producevano e depositavano atti di controversie presso il secondo <em>collaterale</em>, uno dei quattro giudici del tribunale del Senatore. Ogni mese lui e gli altri ventinove professionisti del collegio dei notai del tribunale capitolino mettevano in comune una percentuale degli introiti derivanti dalla loro attività giudiziaria<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a>. Pur non rientrando nella fascia più alta dei compensi, i guadagni di Saravezzi dimostrano che i clienti ricorrevano a lui anche per gli atti giudiziari oltre che per i contratti<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-32\"><sup>32</sup></a>. Come spiega Antonia Fiori nell’articolo “L’obbligazione camerale nei documenti dell’Accademia di San Luca” i notai erano il cuore pulsante del sistema giudiziario. Tutte le azioni legali iniziavano con la comparizione davanti ad un notaio ed essi operavano con notevole autonomia, dal momento che i magistrati si affidavano a loro per compilare citazioni e ingiunzioni cui i giudici avevano già apposto le loro firme.</p>\n<p>La venalità ebbe un impatto immediato, oltre che a lungo termine, su Saravezzi. Nel 1584 gli atti da lui prodotti per i suoi clienti nel corso di un anno riempivano un volume rilegato; sette anni dopo ne occupavano tre. La contrazione del numero dei notai cittadini comportò maggiori affari per Saravezzi. Inoltre, poiché gli atti che rogava per i suoi clienti costituivano ormai un investimento consistente, aveva un forte incentivo a conservarli con cura. Gli inventari dei protocolli in possesso dei trenta notai capitolini documentano un cambiamento epocale negli anni ottanta del Cinquecento, con serie pressoché complete per la maggior parte degli uffici per i successivi tre secoli. Possiamo farci un’idea dello stato in cui erano conservati gli atti dei clienti prima della venalità guardando i volumi sparsi risalenti a prima degli anni ottanta, che sopravvivono in alcuni dei trenta uffici e che spesso consistono in un miscuglio di atti disordinati rogati da notai diversi<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a>. Ancora più avvilente è la raccolta di protocolli denominata Notai Capitolini, custodita nell’Archivio di Stato di Roma, che rappresentò in effetti un tentativo, intrapreso a partire dagli anni sessanta del secolo, di arginare la perdita di volumi che si verificava ogniqualvolta un notaio moriva e la famiglia ereditava il suo archivio segreto di taccuini dai quali aveva tratto il sostentamento. Questa serie, che contiene la maggior parte di ciò che è sopravvissuto in termini di protocolli prodotti a Roma prima del 1586, è in gran parte costituita da ciò che le autorità riuscirono a sottrarre agli eredi dopo la morte di un notaio. L’eccessiva libertà della professione notarile a Roma prima di Sisto V spiega perché sia stato così difficile tracciare l’attività delle associazioni di artisti nei decenni precedenti.</p>\n<p>Un secondo effetto della venalità, che si manifestò gradualmente a partire dagli anni novanta, fu l’aumento del numero di impiegati del notaio. I documenti che troviamo nei protocolli raramente sono di mano di Ottaviano Saravezzi<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a>. Un titolare poteva impiegare uno o due giovani, che verso il 1620 potevano arrivare a quattro o cinque, che si occupassero di gran parte del lavoro di scrittura dell’ufficio, alcuni autorizzati ad agire come notai e altri come semplici scrivani<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a>. L’ufficio aveva una struttura gerarchica, con a capo il <em>padrone</em><a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a>. I <em>sostituti</em> erano impiegati che avevano la qualifica ufficiale di notaio e piena autorità per certificare contratti (atti o strumenti finanziari) e intraprendere attività giudiziarie, come l’assunzione di testimonianze o la redazione di citazioni legali. I <em>giovani</em> erano gli impiegati, che trascrivevano le bozze delle transazioni trasformandole in testi compiuti da conservare nei protocolli; lavoravano da troppo poco tempo per avere i requisiti per ottenere lo status di <em>sostituto</em> oppure per qualche motivo non avevano cercato di ottenerlo. I <em>giovani</em> preparavano anche gli indici  da inserire nei protocolli prima che uscissero per la legatura, seguendo la prassi dell’ufficio o la propria inclinazione nel determinare il nome da dare ai clienti. Fu lo stesso Saravezzi a partecipare all’importante incontro del 7 marzo 1593, ma già dal 1620 circa era molto più comune che fossero i <em>sostituti</em> a documentare i raduni dell’accademia. Sebbene di solito ci fosse un rapido avvicendamento del personale, alcuni dipendenti rimanevano in un determinato ufficio per anni, anche quando cambiava il titolare. Joseph Palmuctius, ad esempio, che lavorò nell’ufficio 15 dal 1621 al 1627, coprì il mandato di tre notai capitolini, Spannocchia, Tigrino e Salvatore. In quel periodo movimentato, il suo nome compare frequentemente come cancelliere delle adunanze dell’accademia<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>L’aumento dei dipendenti rappresentava l’incremento dell’attività dei notai sotto l’impatto della venalità, ma rifletteva anche l’intensificarsi della regolamentazione governativa in relazione agli atti notarili. Dalla metà del Quattrocento in poi, i notai capitolini dovevano rilegare annualmente i loro atti e apporre il proprio nome sulla copertina, ma tra il 1580 e il 1612 le regole per la scrittura notarile si fecero molto più rigide. Nuove leggi municipali e pontificie esigevano che le trascrizioni complete fossero effettuate entro un mese (1580)<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a>, che i volumi notarili fossero rilegati ogni tre mesi (1612), che all’inizio di ogni volume fosse inserito un indice alfabetico con i nomi dei clienti e il numero di foglio di ciascun atto (1612) e che i <em>sostituti</em> apponessero i loro nomi in calce agli atti che avevano rogato (1612)<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a>. La maggior parte di queste misure aveva come obiettivo primario la protezione dell’integrità dei documenti da possibili manomissioni, ma ebbero l’effetto secondario di rendere più facile il tenerne traccia.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1633,"title":"I nuovi notai capitolini del 1586 e i loro verbali","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaieaccademia/II_NotaiCapitolini/"},{"content":"<p>Un controllo più rigoroso delle pratiche di scrittura comportò un maggior lavoro e quindi un numero più alto di scrivani, generalizzò inoltre l’uso dell’indice nei protocolli notarili romani, cosa che ha reso più semplice il compito di trovare gli atti e le riunioni di associazioni di artisti come l’Accademia di San Luca. Tuttavia, il rigore delle regole statali non si estendeva agli usi linguistici e, come abbiamo visto, spesso toccava ai dipendenti subordinati decidere quale nome dare a un cliente societario negli atti notarili. Confraternita (<em>societas</em>) e corporazione (<em>universitas</em>) erano termini familiari e convenzionali, ma come chiamare modalità di associazione inedite o nuove formazioni? L’indice di Ottaviano Saravezzi per il primo volume del 1593 elenca la riunione del 7 marzo 1593 come una <em>congregatio</em> (“congregatio pictorum”), cosa che, nel senso generale del termine di assemblea, corrispondeva certamente alla realtà<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a>. Il notaio e i suoi impiegati preferivano un approccio non discriminante, optando per l’utilizzo di più titoli contemporaneamente, e di conseguenza li vediamo spesso accoppiare “collegio et universitas” (1589), “collegio et societas” (1600), o “collegio et accademia” dei pittori (1626)<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a>: un’inclusività che probabilmente denota un significato più profondo. Generalmente, membri dissidenti o scontenti di un gruppo erano soliti rivolgersi a un notaio differente quando determinati a intraprendere una nuova strada. I promotori dell’iniziativa che portò all’assemblea del marzo 1593 continuarono invece ad  avvalersi dei servizi del notaio Saravezzi, lo stesso che da alcuni anni lavorava per la corporazione e per la confraternita dei pittori. Questa continuità implica la volontà dei fondatori dell’Accademia di Roma di attuare una riforma  dall’interno piuttosto che un desiderio di scissione volto alla formazione di una organizzazione ex novo per gli artisti<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-42\"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Per più di vent’anni la corporazione, la confraternita e l’accademia dei pittori si servirono dell’ufficio 11 di Saravezzi per riunioni, atti commerciali e controversie<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a>. Quando dal 1594 al 1600 Ottaviano scomparve misteriosamente dal collegio dei notai capitolini, gli artisti assunsero Marco Aurelio Saravezzi, e quando Ottaviano tornò nel 1600 rimasero con lui e con il suo successore Alessandro Saravezzi, fino al 1609. Ai notai piaceva avere clienti istituzionali e soprattutto essere formalmente incaricati di assumere la funzione di segretario di un’associazione. Nell’epoca della venalità, tali cariche accrescevano il valore dell’ufficio. I notai che erano stati nominati segretari di un gruppo societario ricevevano spesso un acconto annuo e avevano quindi un reddito stabile garantito. Inoltre, da tali incarichi potevano scaturire affari supplementari quando i membri si recavano per le proprie esigenze personali dallo stesso notaio che avevano conosciuto nelle adunanze delle confraternite o nel tribunale della corporazione. La corporazione dei falegnami lo esigeva addirittura dai suoi membri, come forma di compensazione per il proprio notaio<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a>. Alcune istituzioni, come ad esempio l’ospedale del Santissimo Salvatore di Roma, offrivano un mercato così vincolante riguardo la redazione di documenti, da vendere il diritto di esserne il segretario al miglior offerente<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a>. Sebbene i numerosi statuti revisionati dell’Accademia di San Luca non citino il notaio come segretario, Erasto Spannocchia si identificava come tale<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-46\"><sup>46</sup></a>. Nel 1623 Spannocchia patteggiò con la “confraternita o Accademia” degli artisti una provvigione annua di 3 scudi<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a>. Non ci sono dubbi che ci fosse un rapporto duraturo tra le varie associazioni di pittori e alcuni particolari uffici notarili capitolini, questa infatti era la norma a Roma. Era logico che un’istituzione si affidasse a un solo ufficio, soprattutto quando la pratica comune era di citare gli atti con data e protocollo del notaio piuttosto che pagare per avere una copia personale<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-48\"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>A dispetto del loro lungo legame con l’ufficio 11 di via del Gesù, nel 1609 gli artisti passarono all’ufficio 15, situato a poca distanza, subito a est di piazza Sant’Eustachio, presso il quale mantennero la loro attività per i successivi venticinque anni. La morte di Ottaviano Saravezzi, che si presume sia avvenuta qualche tempo dopo il 1607, potrebbe non essere l’unica spiegazione per questo spostamento, visto che alla fine degli anni novanta del secolo precedente, quando il titolare era Marco Aurelio Saravezzi, i pittori avevano continuato ad affidarsi al suo studio. Oltretutto, nell’autunno 1624 non mostrarono alcuna reazione alla morte del loro segretario Spannocchia, in un periodo molto attivo di riunioni e decisioni, e rimasero fedeli all’ufficio 15 quando tre anni dopo passò per un altro cambio di <em>padrone</em>. Come spiegare l’improvviso passaggio a un nuovo notaio nel 1609?</p>\n<p>Questo gesto sembra segnare un cambiamento di rotta rispetto alla pratica in base alla quale i dissidenti si recavano da un notaio diverso quando avevano rimostranze da fare. I dettagli sono confusi, come è spesso il caso nella storia dei primi anni dell’accademia, ma ci portano a credere che il mandato di Gaspare Celio come <em>principe</em> (direttore) dell’accademia nel 1609 abbia rappresentato il punto di rottura. Celio fu al centro di un intenso conflitto all’interno dell’associazione degli artisti, come chiarisce una ben nota supplica (non datata) al papa da parte della corporazione dei pittori<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-49\"><sup>49</sup></a>. La petizione chiese al pontefice di ordinare al giudice Guazzini de Guazzinis del tribunale del cardinale vicario che era competente per i pittori, di punire Gaspare Celio. I pittori lo accusavano di aver fatto irruzione nell’archivio della confraternita di San Luca e di averne sottratto i documenti. Insinuavano che lui fosse un <em>principe</em> illegittimo, e lo accusavano inoltre di creare nuove regole (<em>capitoli</em>) “contro la libertà e il bene pubblico” e di affiggerle pubblicamente senza il consenso della collettività. Anche se mancano ulteriori dettagli su questa presunta campagna di manifesti avviata da Celio, all’inizio del 1609 il <em>principe</em> si assunse con orgoglio la responsabilità di stampare gli statuti dell’accademia del 1607, piuttosto autoritari. Nell’ultima pagina della prima edizione degli statuti dell’accademia, scrisse di proprio pugno: “Io Gasparo Celio, ora principe dell’Illustrissima Accademia de’ Pittori di Roma, feci stampare il presente volume a richiesta di tutta l’Illustrissima Accademia, e lo confermo di mia mano oggi 27 gennaio 1609”<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-50\"><sup>50</sup></a>. Quel che accadde mette in dubbio il fatto che “tutta” l’accademia avesse davvero avanzato una tale richiesta.</p>\n<p>Pochi mesi dopo, il 12 maggio 1609 quattro membri della “congregazione generale” di San Luca si presentarono nell’ufficio 11 di Alessandro Saravezzi per nominare un avvocato, Severo Particelli, che si occupasse della controversia<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-51\"><sup>51</sup></a>. Il 3 giugno il loro <em>camerlengo</em> fece un pagamento “a nome dell’Accademia e <em>congregatio</em>” a tale Giuseppe Cidonio per rappresentarli davanti al giudice Guazzini de Guazzinis<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-52\"><sup>52</sup></a>. Questo documento del 3 giugno 1609 è l’ultima traccia dei pittori nell’ufficio notarile 11. La successiva transazione dell’accademia che riporti una data, una obbligazione per una stima di routine del 23 luglio 1609, si trova presso l’ufficio 15 di Giovanni Antonio Moschenio, così come i successivi atti, azioni legali e riunioni<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-53\"><sup>53</sup></a>. Poiché il romano Moschenio era il notaio personale di Celio, sembra probabile che quest’ultimo, vendendo i pittori tutti uniti contro di lui, ritenesse che l’unico modo per mantenere il potere fosse spostare l’attività dell’accademia presso un notaio a lui fedele<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-54\"><sup>54</sup></a>. Moschenio si dimostrò però appetibile anche per gli altri soci e conquistò così pienamente la loro fiducia tanto che per sei anni fu anche il loro tesoriere (<em>camerlengo</em>), caso rarissimo nei rapporti notarili con i clienti istituzionali<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-55\"><sup>55</sup></a>. Moschenio non fu l’unico tra i protagonisti di questa vicenda a sopravvivere all’eclisse di Celio dopo il 1612. Colui che consegnò al papa la petizione contro Celio, Agabito Visconti—membro documentato della confraternita dei pittori dal 1595—era ancora profondamente coinvolto nell’incontro dell’8 gennaio 1619, quando fu scelto come uno dei due rappresentanti della confraternita incaricati di riscrivere gli statuti del 1617<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-56\"><sup>56</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Ormai era subentrato nell’ufficio 15 il notaio capitolino Erasto Spannocchia di San Polo in Sabina. Il suo nome compare per la prima volta nel gennaio 1618 in un documento riguardante l’affitto degli edifici attigui alla chiesa dei pittori; morì nell’estate o all’inizio dell’autunno del 1624. Sotto Spannocchia, o forse più tardi, i verbali delle adunanze per il periodo 1618-1621 non furono rilegati nei protocolli ma raccolti in un volume a parte, ora nell’archivio dell’Accademia di San Luca, secondo una prassi che si riscontra sporadicamente presso le altre corporazioni romane<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-57\"><sup>57</sup></a>. L’ufficio di Spannocchia doveva essere ben gestito, perché gli strenui contrasti sulla forma e sulla guida dell’accademia che segnarono il 1624, anno in cui Antiveduto Gramatica fu forzatamente sostituito come <em>principe</em> da Simon Vouet, continuarono a essere ininterrottamente registrati da uno staff che aveva perso il proprio <em>padrone</em><a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-58\"><sup>58</sup></a>. Il successore di Spannocchia fu per breve tempo Lorenzo Tigrino, documentato per la prima volta al lavoro per i pittori nel giugno 1625<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-59\"><sup>59</sup></a>. Nel 1627 Tommaso Salvatore da Spoleto, che nei successivi vent’anni fece del n. 15 uno degli uffici più attivi a Roma, firmava documenti come <em>sostituto</em> di Tigrino<a href=\"/notaendnotesita/#note-60\"><sup>60</sup></a>.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":1431,"title":"L’Accademia di San Luca e i suoi notai","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaieaccademia/III_Accademia_notai_italiano/"},{"content":"<p>I notai che lavorarono per le associazioni dei pittori variamente denominate negli anni che vanno dal 1590 al 1630 depositarono nei loro protocolli gli atti e i verbali delle assemblee da loro prodotti, con poche eccezioni. Come abbiamo visto, questi anni furono segnati da una trasformazione nel modo in cui venivano trattati e valorizzati i protocolli notarili, oggetto di una nuova e scrupolosa attenzione da parte dello Stato e di possibili investitori. In questi decenni a Roma sorsero frequentemente tensioni e conflitti all’interno della comunità degli artisti e dei lavoratori dell’arte, che spesso ebbero come oggetto i documenti più importanti per le rispettive organizzazioni, siano esse <em>universitas, collegio, congregatio, societas,</em> o <em>accademia</em>. A parte le numerose revisioni, in gran parte pacifiche, delle regole di funzionamento dell’accademia, non mancarono gli assalti all’archivio di San Luca. Anche l’inventariazione ossessiva del contenuto degli armadi nelle stanze dell’accademia tradisce una certa ansia rispetto al suo controllo. In un contesto di tali appassionate vicende, i notai dell’accademia dovevano probabilmente fornire il proprio importante contributo rimanendo sullo sfondo: essere presenti, testimoniare, verbalizzare, trascrivere, copiare, archiviare e rilegare. In una città caratterizzata da un grande movimento di persone, anche il gruppo dei notai era necessariamente in continua evoluzione: comparivano e scomparivano con efficiente agilità. Evitando di apparire in prima fila, i notai prestavano attenzione e poi si eclissavano. Sui loro scaffali si accumulavano silenziosamente i protocolli che segnavano il loro successo come funzionari venali. Fortunatamente nessuno li notò e la loro testimonianza riguardo ai primi anni dell’accademia si sarebbe conservata al sicuro per i successivi cinque secoli.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"lnuss"}],"length":260,"title":"Conclusione","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/notaieaccademia/Notai_Conclusioni/"},{"content":"<p>Questo testo è una versione rivista e aggiornata di un saggio dallo stesso nome, pubblicato originariamente nel 2009 in <em>The Accademia Seminars: The Accademia di San Luca in Roma, c. 1590–1635</em>, a cura di Peter M.
